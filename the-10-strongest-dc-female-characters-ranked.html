Poison Ivy/Pamela Isley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0011BF18-9BAA-42BE-A375-6EDDBA5F1FF4.jpeg><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=true>As one of Batman’s most popular antagonists, Poison Ivy has wreaked havoc on Gotham City countless times. She was a botany student in college and was betrayed and poisoned by her teacher and lover, a mishap which made her immune to all poisons and gave her the power to control plant life. Ivy can communicate with plants, making them grow into any pattern, design, or construct that pleases her. Better yet, she is capable of bending all plant life to do her bidding. One of Ivy’s lesser-known skills includes releasing pheromones to seduce and brainwash people.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7.

The years of experimentation left her with supernatural powers, causing her to escape to Earth in search of freedom, eventually joining the Teen Titans. Now known by her superhero moniker, Starfire, she was able to find a new family of her own, consisting of her teammates. Starfire is a very powerful member of the team and can absorb energy and radiation into her body, channelling it out as destructive ‘starbolts.’ She also has super-enhanced senses and reflexes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Raven/Rachel Roth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/F4782CE9-77EE-46D8-B04C-114375D88A50.jpeg><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>As a half-demon, half-human, Raven spent many years battling her conflicting natures and trying to learn to control her powers.

Kara has had her own run of iconic comics, starting from when she was sent to earth from a dying Krypton by her father and her struggles with fitting in, as she didn’t take to the planet as easily as her cousin did. She has fought alongside teams like the Justice League and defeated villains like H’el singlehandedly. Kara possesses the superhuman abilities of the Kryptonians like super-strength and flight, as well as enhanced senses like laser and x-ray vision and heightened hearing. She is also a trained Kryptonian fighter in various martial arts forms.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Wonder Woman/Diana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/D6F69205-089A-4A4F-8896-93DE48DC193C.jpeg><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=910 data-injectable=true>Diana of Themyscira is the daughter of the Amazonian Queen Hippolyta and the king of gods Zeus.

Her powers include superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, healing, and stamina, alongside being an excellently trained fighter in both hand-to-hand combat and multiple weapons. Her weapons of choice include her lasso of truth and bracelets of submission. Very few can defeat Wonder Woman in the entire DC comic book universe.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Zatanna Zatara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/E9EAA20F-1B1C-4429-B483-0AE27DDF46B2.jpeg><p data-characters=850 data-current-count=1150 data-injectable=false>Commonly referred to by just her first name, Zatanna is a powerful magician and a member of the Homo Magi race. She is the daughter of Giovanni Zatara and a member of the Justice League and Justice League Dark. Her magical powers outclass even her father’s and she is often referred to as a Sorceress Supreme. She can cast spells backward to increase their effectiveness and can cast spells without speaking. Her powers also allow her to control weather elements, fly, teleport, and heal people at an accelerated rate. Zatanna is much more than all these though, as she has proven several times in the comic books that she needn’t even utter a word to cast a spell, often choosing to do so to discipline her mind. She can control the minds of others, fling them into other universes, and pretty much whatever it is she puts her mind to.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6m1pnmQaWSsrKKku6ix0q1knZtdm7KurcueZJygkaeupMDEq6pmqpGjuKawjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gwen-grimes-bio-age-husband-job-nked-and-afraid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gwen Grimes?
