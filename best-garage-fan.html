The <a href=# data-name=www.amazon.com/Simple-Deluxe-Inch-3-Speed-Velocity/dp/B0B6P8GGHW data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Simple Deluxe industrial fan</a> is a quieter model on the market due to its lightweight aluminum blades that help keep sound levels low. Also, the high-velocity motor uses lubricated ball bearings that help the fan run smoother and quieter, keeping the <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/annoying-noises-and-how-to-eliminate-them-forever/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener noreferrer">noise level </a>below 50 decibels. Customer reviews confirm this, with many revealing that the fan is unobtrusively quiet.</p><p>Now that we’ve covered sound, let’s talk about features: The fan head can tilt 360 degrees to direct airflow up to 4,650 CFM. It can be easily moved around the garage since it sports a handle and weighs less than 12 pounds.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>High-velocity fan with low noise level</li><li>A lubricated ball-bearing motor provides long-term reliability</li><li>All-metal construction, yet weighs under 12 pounds</li><li>Built-in metal handle makes it easy to carry</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Limited versatility, as only designed for the floor</li></ul><p class=listicle-page__cta-button-shop><a class=shop-btn data-name=www.amazon.com/Simple-Deluxe-Inch-3-Speed-Velocity/dp/B0B6P8GGHW data-module="Content Recirculation" data-position="Shop Now Button" href=# data-product-name data-product-price data-product-category data-product-retailer data-content-rating rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shop Now</a></p><p><span class=current-page-count>10</span> <span class=card-count-divider>/</span> <span class=total-page-count>10</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Minka-Aire-Xtreme-H20-65-Ceiling-Fan-with-Remote-Control_ecomm_via-amazon.com_.jpg> <span class=credits-overlay><span class="image-credit noskim">via merchant</span></span><h2>Best Splurge Garage Fan</h2><h3>Minka-Aire Xtreme H20 Ceiling Fan</h3><p>The <a href=# data-name=www.amazon.com/Minka-Aire-F896-65-CL-Xtreme-Ceiling-Finish/dp/B07F7M1XTH data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Minka-Aire</a> is well worth its higher-than-average price tag given its smooth and quiet operation while still moving a lot of air. It comes with a 65-inch blade span and moves 9,036 CFM of air with its eight-blade design—perfect for standard single or two-car garages. The contemporary design has multiple finish options: Flat white, brushed nickel, coal or oil-rubbed bronze, so it’s easy to find a finish that complements your <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/pro-tips-for-planning-your-dream-garage/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener noreferrer">dream garage</a>. Even more, this ceiling fan is wet-rated in case you leave the garage door open during a rainstorm.</p><p>A major perk of a garage ceiling fan is that it can be used year-round to make your garage more comfortable and safe, just by changing the fan direction. By circulating air counterclockwise in the summer, the fan pushes cooler air down. Adjusting the direction clockwise in the winter months warms the garage by pulling cool air up toward the ceiling, which displaces the warm air that rises and collects near the ceiling. Finally, a one-year warranty is included making this ceiling fan amazing from all angles.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Sleek contemporary design with multiple finish options</li><li>6-speed remote with forward/reverse and light-dimming</li><li>Quiet, especially for the amount of air it moves</li><li>Ideal in either warm or cold months</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-install-ceiling-fans/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener noreferrer">Installing a new ceiling fan</a> is more complex and can involve installing a fan bracket and a new junction box</li><li>Pricier than other options on our list</li></ul><p class=listicle-page__cta-button-shop><a class=shop-btn data-name=www.amazon.com/Minka-Aire-F896-65-CL-Xtreme-Ceiling-Finish/dp/B07F7M1XTH data-module="Content Recirculation" data-position="Shop Now Button" href=# data-product-name data-product-price data-product-category data-product-retailer data-content-rating rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shop Now</a></p><h2>What to Consider When Buying a Garage Fan</h2><p>Here are some things you need to consider when buying a garage fan:</p><ul><li><strong>Airflow:</strong> The CFM capacity of a fan tells you about a fan’s airflow, which is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). Generally, you want at least 1,000 CFM per 100 square feet. For a standard two-car garage, you would need a fan (or two) with a total CFM of 4,000-6,000.</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Make sure your fan can withstand dents and dings that can often happen in your garage by looking for these components: A sturdy metal stand, water-resistant materials, sturdy frame and metal fan blades.</li><li><strong>Size:</strong> A garage fan will be at least 16 inches in diameter, though you may go bigger if you have a larger garage. On the other hand, a 12-inch fan may be a welcome addition to cool your workspace and not the entire garage.</li><li><strong>Noise:</strong> Most garage fans are loud with powerful motors. There are quieter options in this list but if you’re using your garage as a workspace with <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/woodworking-portable-power-tools/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">power tools</a>, the noise level may be the least of your concerns. The noise level of a fan is measured as sones. If you prefer a relatively quiet space to focus and plan, you would want a fan with a rating of 4.0 sones or less.</li><li><strong>Oscillating vs. Tilting vs. Vortex:</strong> Oscillating fans move side to side to distribute air in multiple directions. This oscillating motion covers a larger area with airflow. The tilting feature can move the head up and down or anywhere in between to direct airflow where it is needed. A vortex fan blows air in a tight little column across the room, moving more air without the distraction of intermittent gusts that you would get from an oscillating fan.</li></ul><h2>Types of Garage Fans</h2><ul><li><strong>Floor Garage Fans:</strong> Designed to sit on the floor, these work well for setting up where you work to keep that area cool. The fan distributes air horizontally, staying low near the floor, and circulates air in the immediate area, which works well since warm air rises and cold air sinks. Floor fans are usually the most portable option as they tend to be lightweight. They may require a small amount of assembly, but no mounting installation. The biggest drawback is the floor space they take up and the potential tripping hazard.</li><li><strong>Pedestal Garage Fans:</strong> These sit on the floor atop an adjustable stand and can be useful if you want air directed at a height above ground, angled toward the ceiling for an indirect breeze or at a certain spot in the room. The pedestal fan takes up floor space but is less obtrusive with its slender base, making it a solid choice for a small garage. Daniel Dunlap, owner of DD Woodworks and co-host of Another Woodshop podcast, agrees that a pedestal garage fan is a smart choice: “It does a great job of moving the air while keeping a small footprint.” Daniel uses a heavy-duty 30-inch pedestal fan and absolutely loves it, as it’s powerful, height adjustable and fairly portable. <strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Wall-Mounted Garage Fans:</strong> While these require installation, they free up your floor space and are less likely to accumulate dust and dirt. Since they’re on the wall, there’s no chance of tripping over the cord. But beware of mounting too low. This more permanent solution can provide airflow to the entire space but also might be limited on how far the cooling air reaches. Look for ones with remote controls or that can be wired to a <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/smart-home/devices/light-switches/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">light switch</a>.</li><li><strong>Ceiling Garage Fans</strong>: These should be wet-rated and ETL damp-rated in case the <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/garage-door-insulation-kits/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">garage door</a> is left open and the fan gets wet during a storm. The fan direction can be changed on a ceiling fan so it is an energy-efficient way of keeping the garage cool in the summer and circulating warm air in the winter.</li></ul><h2>Why You Should Trust Us</h2><p>As an award-winning woodworker, I have experience with woodworking, DIY and home decor. I’m also the owner of a one-woman woodworking shop where I’m slowly replacing out-of-the-box furniture with furniture made by hand. For this article, I also enlisted the expertise of Tisha Grant, who specializes in interior design, and Daniel Dunlap, who has been a professional woodworker for more than 25 years.</p><h2>How We Found the Best Garage Fans</h2><p>With my years of experience as a professional woodworker, and personal experience completing a garage makeover, I scoured hundreds of models and their reviews from a handful of retailers including Amazon, Costco, Home Depot and Lowe’s. I considered floor, pedestal fans, oscillating and vortex fans, among other designs. I didn’t include <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/tower-fan-guide/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">tower fans</a> because they’re rarely as powerful as most other large fans (and <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-clean-a-tower-fan/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">tower fan maintenance</a> is a pain—involving disassembly to gain access to the blades). When narrowing down the choices of the best garage fans, I considered multiple factors like noise output, CFM and how easy it is to assemble. In addition, I reached out to a slew of experts who have an intimate knowledge of garage fans, having used them often in their own workshops.</p><h2>People Also Ask</h2><h3>What is the best CFM for a garage fan?</h3><p>The best CFM (cubic feet per minute) for a garage fan depends on several factors, including the size of your garage and fan blades, and tilt or direction of the fan. Generally, you want at least 1,000 CFM per 100 square feet. A standard two-car garage that is approximately 450-square feet would need a CFM rating of 4,000-6,000.</p><h3>What size fan for a two-car garage?</h3><p>If you want personal cooling that is easy to move around, then a 12-inch fan would work well. If a fan is stationary and not moved often, then 18-inch fan or larger will benefit most garage spaces. The CFM rating is another consideration and will tell you how much our flow is being moved. Manufacturers also give an idea of the area covered. A ceiling fan for a standard two-car garage would require a blade span of 50 to 60 inches. For a larger garage that is more than 400 square feet, a larger fan with a blade span of over 62 inches is best.</p><h3>Is it good to put a fan in the garage?</h3><p>There are many advantages to putting a fan in the garage. It helps ventilate your garage and cool it down, providing you with a more comfortable and safe workspace.
