The former pornstar has opened up about how predatory the porn industry is. She has now explained how her family was not aware of what her career was. However, when they came face to face with reality, they disowned her. Khalifa explains that her jump into the <a href=#>porn industry</a> was an “impulsive act of rebellion.” She claims she wanted to do something “out of bounds” and “out of character.”</p><p>The celebrity explains that her family was not in favor of her doing adult films. Mia Khalifa states, “They disowned me when they found out. I felt completely alienated by not just the world, but my family and the people around me. Especially after I quit, when I was still alone, even though I left. And I just realised some mistakes aren’t forgivable. But time heals all wounds, and things are getting better now.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mia_Khalifas_family_disowned_her_after_knowing_what_she_does></span>Mia Khalifa’s family disowned her after knowing what she does<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“I don’t think low self-esteem discriminates against anyone. It doesn’t matter if you come from a great family or if you come from a not-so-great background. I struggled my entire childhood with weight and I never felt attractive or worthy of male attention. And suddenly my first year of college I start losing all this weight from making small changes and by the time I graduated I was ready to make a bigger difference. After feeling what it was like – that validation and the compliments for the first time – I did not want that to go away.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mia-Khalifa-talks-her-earnings-as-a-pornstarr.jpg alt width=1440 height=810 data-sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Mia Khalifa explains how she entered the porn industry. She says, “I was approached at a very vulnerable point in my life. I went back and shot a scene, and it was terrifying and temporarily validating, but afterwards I felt a little empty. Though I still had that pit in my stomach where I wanted to chase that validation again… I think what made me go back and do it again was that the attention I was receiving, I was afraid it would go away if I didn’t do what I was asked to do.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_it_affect_her_relationships></span>Did it affect her relationships?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>By the time she turned 22, she was the most-searched pornstar on PornHub. For Mia Khalifa, it was not easy. She says her time in the industry has left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. The same thing has also severed her relationships. Khalifa explains,&nbsp; “Of course, it affects relationships. The things that men see in videos, they expect from the women in their lives, and that’s just not reality. No one is doing to be that perfect, no one is going to do those acts on a Wednesday night with the person they love.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mia-Khalifa-died.-Find-out-the-truth-of-what-happened-to-the-actress.jpg alt width=1322 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 1322px) 100vw, 1322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Mia Khalifa’s biggest stunt came when she filmed sex acts in a hijab. Even though she right away entered PornHub’s Hall of Fame, the world wasn’t all that happy. For starters, she started receiving threats from ISIS sympathizers, and her information was made public and exposed. Following this, she was shunned by her family. She states, “[Porn] corporations prey on callow young women and trap them legally into contracts when they’re vulnerable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2ikopldoLWiuMifmGarka7Abr%2FHnmSwmaNisaq%2FzrClnpxdl8ZutMSrZJ%2BZnZ65uns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sebastian-stan-richard-madden-look-alike.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sebastian Stan Reacts To Being Richard Maddens Look Alike">&larr;
