He made his debut in Season 2 which aired in 2012.&nbsp;Since then he has been a regular on the show.&nbsp;Alongside his family, Kilcher is well loved by viewers of the show as their hardships and trials teach viewers various survival skills to use in situations lacking modern conveniences.</span></p><p><span>Despite how difficult things get for the Kilcher family, Shane’s sense of humor makes him a character who enjoys being on screen.&nbsp;In addition to his sense of humor and survival instinct, Shane Kilcher is also interested in poetry and singing.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio by Shane Kilcher</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shane Kilcher was born on the 5th&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;May 1971 in Fairbanks, Alaska.&nbsp;He is of Swiss descent;&nbsp;His grandparents – Ruth Weber and Yule Kilcher – fled Switzerland to settle in Alaska during World War II.&nbsp;Shane is a third generation of the Kilcher family living in Alaska.&nbsp;He is the son of musician and television personality Atz Kilcher and singer Lenedra Kilcher (née Carroll).&nbsp;Shane grew up in Fairbanks with his three siblings.&nbsp;He is the older brother of international pop star Jewel, who has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.&nbsp;His other two siblings are Atz Lee, who stars in the series, and his half-brother, Nikos, who is a professional singer.</span></p><p><span>In 1998, he founded a nonprofit organization called Higher Ground for Humanity with his mother and sister.&nbsp;The NGO was founded to promote alternative health care, arts, spiritual development, research, education about the environment and alliances with like-minded organizations.&nbsp;According to his LinkedIn page, he worked at the Clean Water Project from 1997 to 2010.&nbsp;The project targets villages that lack clean water and looks for ways to find sustainable solutions to their problems.&nbsp;The project is currently active in over 18 countries worldwide including: Honduras, Mexico, India, the United States and some other countries in Africa.</span></p><h2><strong><span>assets</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shane Kilcher is believed to be worth 4 million dollars.&nbsp;This assumption is based on the fact that his Alaska: The Last Frontier co-star, Otto Kilcher, has an estimated net worth of $4 million.&nbsp;Therefore, it is assumed that Shane is around the same net worth, if not more.&nbsp;He is paid between $7,000 and $10,000 for each episode of Atlanta: The Last Frontier so he can support himself and his family.</span></p><p><span>As well as what is being made of the show, the Kilcher family owns 613 acres around their homestead, and local records show they claim an additional 207 acres in and around the town of Homer.&nbsp;The homestead is valued at over $800,000 and the family’s total real estate is approximately $3.6 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>who is his wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shane Kilcher met his wife Kelli Ware at Stellar Middle School and shortly thereafter they became sweethearts.&nbsp;After dating for three years, the two tied the knot in June 1992.&nbsp;Kelli continued her education after marriage, graduating from Maric College in 1999 with a degree in nursing.&nbsp;Together they have four children: Keena Tarik;&nbsp;Jareth;&nbsp;reid;&nbsp;and Jenna.&nbsp;They have since formed a blissful marriage that showcases their bond and synergy with episodes of Alaska: The Last Frontier to the delight of their viewers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What happened to Shane Kilcher?&nbsp;His injury update and more</span></strong></h2><p><span>Shane Kilcher and his wife Kelli Ware were working on a new cabin on their homestead when Shane fell off a ladder and broke his back.&nbsp;He was immediately taken to Central Peninsula Hospital in Homer, where he was told he had a horizontal fracture.&nbsp;This fracture occurred at his L2 vertebra and extended two-thirds through the bone.</span></p><p><span>Kerri Ware shared news of the incident on her Facebook page, to the shock of fans.&nbsp;She thanked the fans for their prayers and kind wishes, telling them that despite his good performances, Shane still had a long recovery to go.&nbsp;Over time, she has shown by replying to comments on the Facebook page that he is getting better every day thanks to modern medicine and the mountain herbs near her homestead.&nbsp;Shane Kilcher had used mountain herbs for bruises and sprains in the past.&nbsp;However, she was unable to reveal any further details about his status in order to maintain the integrity of the reality show.</span></p><p><span>Discovery Channel announced it was getting started, but there was no clue if Shane Kilcher would be appearing in the upcoming season or not.&nbsp;The best thing fans can do is extend their prayers for him and see if he shows up at the new season’s premiere.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
