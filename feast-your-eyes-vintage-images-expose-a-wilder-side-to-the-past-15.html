Behind their very public lives were real people with lives that were filled with excitement, heartache, highs, and lows. As you scroll through these slides and learn about the actors, singers, models, and other celebrities of the 1950s. 1960s. 1970s, and beyond, you will appreciate the achievements and contributions they made to our pop culture.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/3519519e8eb522680624442dfd2c234a.jpg" alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Reddit</span><p>Remember Adam Ant? The English singer was a leader of the new wave genre in the early to mid-1980s. With his funky style and unique voice, he and his group, Adam and the Ants, were chart toppers in the UK with three back-to-back number one hits. A forerunner of the second wave of the British Invasion, Adam Ant parlayed his musical popularity into an acting career. In this photo, Adam Ant is posing with singer Rick James whose musical styles were quite different than his. Rick James was known for his bend of rock and funk.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Stevie Nicks in 1977, photographed by Sam Emerson.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/b8c4576d02dcce1b31c4b2a9ff664bf8.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>In the late 1970s, Stevie Nicks often wore black outfits when she was performing. She said it was because black is slimming, and she felt better wearing that color. But a bunch of craze fans began accusing her of being a witch and dabbling in Satanism. Nicks tried to assure people that she was not a witch, but the accusations kept coming. These people were so threatening and intimidated that, out of fear, Nicks stopped wearing black on stage. But she later said she never felt pretty in the seafoam greens and peach outfits that she wore. Finally, in 1983, she went back to dressing the way she wanted to while performing and she learned to turn a blind eye to the rumors spread about her.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Another celeb couple back in the day was Rick Springfield and Linda Blair, he was 25 and she was 15 when they met and dated from 1974-76</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/04a00021537ecb0d894bbae020828677.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>In the 1970s, it seems, folks didn’t raise much of an eyebrow to underage relationships. Singer Rick Springfield was a 25-year-old struggling musician in the seventies when he did a show at the Whiskey A Go Go. Afterward, Linda Blair, one of the hottest young Hollywood actresses of the time thanks to her recent role in The Exorcist, approached Springfield and asked him if he would like to join her at the club down the street for a drink. She noted that her sister, Debbie, would buy him a drink. He soon learned why. Blair was only 15 years old. That didn’t stop him from accepting the invitation. The couple enjoyed their drink, then went back to Springfield’s apartment to enjoy other things. Blair and Springfield kept their relationship quiet, but the press caught wind of it. As you can imagine, Springfield faced some scrutiny about his underaged lover.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Cheryl Tiegs was the model for the 'Scotch' hair set tape in 1968</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/5c8406af84c94197e017be522b337c12.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Some of the products of the past really make us scratch our heads. Case in point, Scotch Hair Set Tape, which pretty Cheryl Tiegs so beautifully modeled. Yes, this was tape for hair. According to the Scotch company, there were several ways the hair tape could be used. In this advertisement, the tape is used to hold pin curls in place and, according to the ad, it was much more comfortable to sleep with tape in your hair instead of bobby pins or curlers. The tape could also be used to hold hair in place until the gel or hairspray dried. You could all tape your hair down before you went to bed so you wouldn’t wake up with bedhead. Genius.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Did someone order a tongue sandwich?

In this pic, we see Simmons and Cher as guest stars on The Mike Douglas Show. Did you know that Simmons and Cher dated in the late 1970s and even lived together? During the time they were in a relationship, however, Simmons fell in love with singer Diana Ross, who he later lived with as well. These two weren’t the only girls in Simmons’ life. He has claimed to have slept with a many as 5,000 women in his lifetime.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Bill Bixby, Mr. Rogers and Lou Ferrigno on the set of 'The Incredible Hulk,' 1979</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/73a2042ac9ee1e677e71f91b419c4233.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Reddit</span><p>This ranks up there as one of the strangest crossovers in television history. In 1980, Mr. Rogers left the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to go on a field trip to the set of the TV show, The Incredible Hulk. There, he met with actors Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno and gave his audience a behind-the-scenes look at how Ferrigno was transformed in to the frightening green Hulk. There was a reason for this bizarre visit. Ratings showed that kids weren’t watching The Incredible Hulk because they were scared of the Hulk. By having the totally non-scary Mr. Rogers show kids that it was all make believe, it was hoped that rating would rise.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Keith Richards, David Bowie and Tina Turner partying back in the good ol' days.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/6994a75605559429288a75d7dc846110.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>That’s a lot of talent in one photograph. You know it is a great party when Keith Richards, Tina Turner, and David Bowie all show up. Here’s an interesting question. If there was karaoke at this party, do you think this trio would sing The Rolling Stone’s hit “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction”, Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do with It?”, or David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance”? There's enough Jack Daniel's there that who knows what song they would pick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Agnetha and Frida, the voice of ABBA, 1970s.

Oops. To make the ABBA name work, the singers used Frida’s birth name, Anni-Frid Lyngstad. ABBA consisted of two married couples, Lyngstad and Benny Andersson and Agnetha Faltskog and Bjorn Ulvaeus. They formed ABBA in 1972 and had success with such hits as “Waterloo,” “Fernando”, “Mamma Mia,” “Dancing Queen,” “Take a Chance on Me”, and “Knowing Me, Knowing You.”</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Cher showing off her slim figure at the 1973 Academy Awards.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/42db4841d686e1134e668236bc3c50ec.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Beautiful, slim Cher attended the 1973 Academy Awards Presentation where she watched The Sting win in the Best Picture category, Jack Lemmon win the Best Actor Oscar for Save the Tiger, and young Tatum O’Neil will the Best Supporting Actress honors for Paper Moon.

They were, of course, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” “She Bop,” “Time After Time,” “and “All Through the Night.” Perhaps her biggest hit was “True Colors” off her second album of the same name. She was also featured on the soundtrack for the action movie, The Goonies.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Sharon Tate, 1960s</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/338e8f8d89b3e4fcc4d45fc1dedb3bbc.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>source: pinterest</span><p>Although Valley of the Dolls, the 1967 drama movie based on the novel by Jacqueline Susann, had some worthy stars – Sharon Tate, Patty Duke, Lee Grant, Barbara Parkins, and Susan Hayward, to name a few – the film was generally panned by critics. At the box office, it was a success, but film critics called it “trashy and campy”. Others labeled it “melodramatic”. It was named one of the Fifty Worst Films of All Time and received a BOMB rating by critic Leonard Maltin. Despite the negative reviews, Valley of the Dolls still has a loyal cult following.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Farrah Fawcett's disco chic' dress she wore to the 1978 Academy Awards.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/438b26408c8b5a71dd8624643d01f4a3.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Farrah Fawcett was invited to present the Oscar for Best Film Editing at the 1978 Academy Awards Presentation. She came dressed to impress in a loose, slinky tank dress with a fluid look to it. Designed by Stephen Burrows, the gold chainmail gown had thin spaghetti straps, a plunging neckline, and an open back that left Farrah at risk of exposing too much side book. Her dress perfectly captured the disco vibe that, thanks to Studio 54, was so popular at the time.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Groovy photo of Elton John and Stevie Wonder, 1973</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/5692e4b10be8f4ec0f72a5766f1d9013.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Stevie Wonder and Elton John have been friends for decades. Both are giants in the music industry and have inspired the next generations of musicians. Yet, it took them until 2021 to finally collaborate on a project. The two iconic singers teamed up for the song “Finish Line”, a sweet and nostalgic tune, that appeared on Stevie Wonder’s most recent album, Lockdown Sessions. In fact, the music video for “Finish Line” commemorates there more than fifty year friendship.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Donny and Marie Osmond with their mini-me's in 1976</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/6bb3ca27e8a6f61aeff804e8e5977de2.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Perhaps the most successful brother-sister act of all time, Donny and Marie Osmond were 18 and 16 years old respectively when they started this hit television variety show in 1976. Donny Osmond had already logged plenty of TV time as a member of the Osmond Brothers singing group, but sister Marie, the only daughter of the Osmond’s nine children, wanted to show off her singing chops too. The variety show launched Donny and Marie to teen idol status. And, as you can see here, they inspired Barbie to make special Donny and Marie dolls.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>If you ever wondered what Yvonne De Carlo looked like without the 'Lily Munster' makeup and hair, here she is in the 1950's.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/975135751591dd9ecc29cdaf5addcda2.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Did you know that Yvonne De Carlo was the first American movie star to visit Israel?

Living in the city was exhilarating, but also fraught with dangers. In her recently released autobiography, Harry talks about being robbed, raped at knifepoint, and accepting a ride from a man at 2 a.m. who she now thinks was Ted Bundy. Still, she said the 1970s were an exciting and romantic to be a New Yorker. The music and art scenes were thriving, cutting-edge, and eclectic.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Jacqueline Bisset in Vogue Paris, November 1973.</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/23bedecca44162a1db69b4452138fdee.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Source: Pinterest</span><p>Did you know that Jacqueline Bisset’s real first name in Winifred?

Saturday Night Fever was a commercial and critical success and helped to shine a light on the disco subculture, which was much more than just music and dancing.

It shines a critical light on such concepts as patriarchy, feminism, transgenderism, societal norms and perceived deviant behavior.
