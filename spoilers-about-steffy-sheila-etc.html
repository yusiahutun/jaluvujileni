She didn’t go there the first time Finn supposedly died, so why on earth would she go there the second time he supposedly died, except to give Hope a reason to crow about how right she was about Steffy always having been right there waiting to interfere in her marriage? Steffy/Finn/Sinn shouldn’t exist just to justify Hope or her decisions. Her choices should just be her choices, whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent.</p><p><span class=post-likes>11 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>July 15, 2023, 2:54pm <span itemprop=position>16</span></span><p>That would be perfect. Or he could go back to the Toolshed, accompanied by Brooke, who’d just finished convincing Liam to go to the Toolshed, where Brooke had set her Hope up to be, to think once more about the life he’d shared there with his family before he gives up on Hope and their marriage completely. Only Hope hadn’t gone to the Toolshed alone, she’s with Thomas, and that’s what Brooke and Liam walk into together.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/lynn1216/48/25788_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Lynn1216:<p>He loves Steffy he’s not throwing her under he bus.</p><p>He’s thrown her under the bus plenty of times.</p><p>When it came to her and Bill the first go around with Katie, she put the blame on Steffy and wanted to keep her family together. Nevermind your husband who actually wanted her and had she not had a heartattack, would have actually left her. (Which in my opinion just makes Katie look like a weak fool).</p><p>He threw her under the bus when she cheated on Liam with Bill, (which in my opinion was totally out of character for her at that time), then because of that she had to have a paternity test.</p><p>Then we had months of Hope and Brooke slandering her taking about how sweet little Hope would never do what big bad Steffy did, and Steffy begging Liam for another chance and begging Hope to help her. For those months Steffy’s character was constantly thrown under the bus.</p><p>Then when Steffy fans were thrown a bone when Finn came on, right back under that bus Steffy went when they had her sleep with Liam and had to have another paternity test.</p><p>So yes, Bell has thrown Steffy under the bus quite a bit.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>All i saw was bill bei g tbrown under the bus to prop steam<br>To the point where bill locked his wife in a tower knowing she had a bad heart</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/queensteph/48/3751_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> QueenSteph:<p>Finn issues a warning.</p><p>OMG, OMG, if this warning is directed at Liam, I’m going to have the popcorn popped and glued to the tv.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sea1.discourse-cdn.com/sheknowssoaps/message-boards/user_avatar/soaps.sheknows.com/queensteph/48/3751_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> QueenSteph:<p>Liam witnesses something shocking.</p><p>I hope he sees Thomas & Hope in a very romantic setting.
