There isn’t one type of strength, either. Some characters top the charts with their superhuman physical strength, while others have nifty abilities capable of mass destruction. Whatever the case may be, you’ll find a list of the strongest characters in My Hero Academia below.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false><strong>Beware spoilers for My Hero Academia.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>A Ranking of the Strongest Characters in My Hero Academia</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>10. Shoto (Shoto Todoroki)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shoto.jpg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>The youngest son of Pro Hero Endeavor, Shoto has a perfect mixture of his parents’ fire and ice Quirks. Named <strong>Half-Cold Half-Hot</strong>, his Quirk lets him create ice from the right side of his body and fire from his left. Unlike Endeavor who can overheat if he uses too much of his fire, Shoto can use his ice to regulate his body temperature, eliminating his father’s biggest weakness.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>It’s clear that Shoto is a formidable opponent, although some fans may wonder why he isn’t higher on this list. My reasoning is that despite having an extremely powerful Quirk, Shoto is nowhere near mastering it. This is likely to change as he gains more experience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>9. Dynamight (Katsuki Bakugo)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dynamight-Katsuki-Bakugo.jpg><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Deku’s childhood friend and rival, Katsuki Bakugo’s hero name, <strong>Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight</strong>, makes his Quirk and its strength pretty obvious. Thanks to the ability to sweat a nitroglycerin-like substance, Dynamight can create explosions from his hands at will. These range from small explosions used to propel himself through the air to massive attacks that can destroy entire buildings.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>Other than his Quirk’s highly offensive nature, Dynamight is also a keen tactician, which further adds to his strength. His only weakness is that since his Quirk relies on sweat, it takes him slightly longer to detonate in cold weather.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>8. Dabi (Toya Todoroki)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dabi-Toya-Todoroki1.jpg><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Now revealed to be Endeavor’s oldest son Toya Todoroki, the villain Dabi’s <strong>Blueflame</strong> produces ultra-hot flames that incinerate everything in their path. When he was just a child, Endeavor called his flames hotter than his own. As an adult, he was easily able to overpower his younger brother Shoto’s flames.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>However, despite his Quirk’s strength, Dabi’s got one fatal weakness. He inherited his mother’s ice resistance instead of his father’s fire resistance. As a result, his own fire burns him, and he cannot sustain it for long periods of time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>All My Hero Academia Characters’ Ages, Heights, Birthdays, and Zodiac Signs</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>7. Lemillion (Mirio Togata)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemillion-Mirio-Togata1.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>Going by the hero name Lemillion, Mirio Togata of <a href=#>UA’s “Big Three”</a> boasts a very powerful, but difficult to master Quirk. Called <strong>Permeation</strong>, his unique Quirk lets him become intangible and phase through objects. This allows him to dodge bullets, walk through walls, and even teleport by phasing through the ground and re-emerging at a different spot.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>The original top candidate for inheriting One For All, Lemillion’s Quirk has just one major weakness. Since being intangible means light and air also pass through him, he can only stay in that state for as long as he can hold his breath and loses all five senses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>6. Deku (Izuku Midoriya)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Deku-Izuku-Midoriya1.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>As the <strong>ninth user of One For All</strong>, Deku has access to all the previous users’ Quirks. These include <strong>Blackwhip</strong> that lets him produce whip-like tendrils from any part of his body, <strong>Float</strong> which lets him levitate, <strong>Danger Sense</strong> which alerts him of nearby potential threats, <strong>Smokescreen</strong> that lets him produce thick purple smoke, and <strong>Fa Jin</strong> that builds up kinetic energy via repetitive movements.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Add in the superhuman strength granted by One For All, and it’s clear that Deku has the potential to become Number One on the hero charts. He just has a long way to go before he can use that strength to the fullest.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>5. Gigantomachia&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gigantomachia.jpg><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>A former bodyguard of All For One, not much is known about Gigantomachia’s real name or past. With <strong>six extra Quirks</strong> alongside his original one, Machia is an absolute beast on the battlefield. His original Quirk, <strong>Endurance</strong>, converts his morale into physical energy and stamina.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>His extra Quirks grant him the ability to change his size, dig like a mole, and function on very small amounts of food and water. He also has immunity to pain, hardened muscles, and increased smell and hearing. But despite all his strength, he is merely a loyal servant who acts on All For One’s orders.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. Endeavor (Enji Todoroki)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pro-hero-Endeavor.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Number One on the Hero Billboard Chart after All Might’s retirement, Endeavor boasts an impressive fire Quirk called <strong>Hellflame</strong> which lets him create and control fire. His ultimate move, Flashfire Fist: Prominence Burn, is powerful enough to completely char even Shigiraki’s highly-enhanced body. He is also very physically strong, successfully knocking Gigantomachia over with one fire enhanced tackle.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Additionally, Endeavor’s so durable the <a href=#>High-End Nomu Hood</a> thought he could regenerate. And All For One himself was impressed with his speed when taking down several mid-level Nomus. His only weakness is that while his skin is heat-resistant, his organs aren’t and can overheat if he uses too much of his Quirk.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>All My Hero Academia Filler Episodes – Filler List</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>3. All Might (Toshinori Yagi)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/all-might.jpg><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>The Symbol of Peace who brought crime rate down to less than 6%, All Might was the <strong>eighth user of One For All</strong>. The Quirk granted him immense physical strength, with a single punch being enough to make it rain.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>He’s also extremely fast, being able to punch a bioengineered Nomu 300 times in just a few seconds to overcome its shock absorption. His strongest smash attack, United States of Smash, concentrates all his power into one fist. He used this to win against One For All following Dynamight’s kidnapping.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2. Tomura Shigaraki (Tenko Shimura)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shigaraki.jpg><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>One of the main antagonists of the series and All For One’s successor, Tomura Shigaraki’s Quirk <strong>Decay</strong> lets him destroy anything he touches. With Dr. Ujiko’s assistance, this Quirk becomes even more powerful, easily disintegrating a large part of the city and everyone in it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Shigaraki also gains a bunch of new Quirks once he inherits All For One. These include <strong>Hyper-Regeneration</strong>, <strong>Forced Quirk Activation</strong>, <strong>Search</strong>, <strong>Air Cannon</strong>, and <strong>Radio Waves</strong>. Air Cannon fires blasts of pressurized air from his palms, while Radio Waves causes communicators to malfunction. Search was originally Ragdoll’s Quirk and lets Shigaraki monitor as many as 100 people at a time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>1. All For One (Shigaraki)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/all-for-one.jpg><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>The anime’s central antagonist, All For One, has been around since Quirks first emerged. With the ability to <strong>steal and transfer Quirks</strong>, he has stockpiled a large collection of useful Quirks to always have at his disposal.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=false>He has Ragdoll’s Search Quirk, an Anti-Aging Quirk, a teleportation Quirk, an Impact Reversal Quirk, the ability to combine all physical Quirks into a single arm, and many more. He was responsible for the injury that eventually ended All Might’s career, and has no known weaknesses.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
