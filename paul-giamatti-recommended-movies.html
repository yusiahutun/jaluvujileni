He turned in one of the year's funniest and most poignant performances in <strong>Alexander Payne</strong>'s <a href=#><strong>The Holdovers</strong></a> as the zany, grouchy teacher Paul Hunham. It's just the latest in a string of wonderful <a href=#>performances from the actor</a>, from <strong>Sideways</strong> and <strong>Cinderella Man</strong> to <strong>John Adams</strong> and <strong>Private Life</strong>.

He's joined by <strong>Isabella Rossellini</strong> as lounge singer Dorothy Vallens and <strong>Laura Dern</strong> as Sandy Williams, the daughter of a local detective. Their stories intertwine in a surreal odyssey through the criminal underworld. All the while, they are stalked by the vicious killer Frank Booth (<strong>Dennis Hopper</strong>), who is as disturbed as he is sadistic. <strong>The film polarized audiences on release but has since been recognized as one of Lynch's best projects.</strong></p><p>"This is the movie that I think, for better or worse, really pushed me over the edge and made me go ‘I wanna be an actor’" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giamatti said</a>.

As the story is told from the perspectives of a woodcutter (<strong>Takashi Shimura</strong>), a bandit (<strong>Toshiro Mifune</strong>), the samurai's wife (<strong>Machiko Kyō</strong>), and even the spirit of the deceased samurai (<strong>Masayuki Mori</strong>) himself, the movie confronts the subjectivity of memory. <strong>This structure, termed the Rashomon effect, would go on to be emulated by countless movies and shows.</strong></p><p>"It’s the only movie that makes me cry," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giamatti said</a>.

Moreover, it strikes a balance between fondness and satire, offering a critique of British society, especially the military, without descending into harshness. "There’s this great sequence that builds up to this wonderful duel," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giamatti said</a>. "It’s a very funny movie. It’s a very moving movie.
