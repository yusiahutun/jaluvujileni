She looks stressed out.</p><p>At Il Giardino, Deacon and Hollis discuss Tom’s collapse. He was fine before he went onstage last night. Finn comes in and says he heard at the hospital that Tom died there last night. Deacon thanks him for coming. “I need to know why he went down like that. What happened?” They go over how he seemed fine before going on stage. Finn says it wasn’t a stroke or an aneurysm. “Tom died of a drug overdose.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Y&R couple crossing over to B&B</a></p><p>At Bill’s house, he joins Poppy, who thought he was at work. He asks what’s going on. “Is something wrong?” Bill says she looks like she’s been crying. Poppy admits she’s feeling a little emotional. Bill tells her if something is upsetting her, he wants to hear about it. “There’s nothing you can’t tell me.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bil-Pop-.jpg alt="Bill Poppy B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In Forrester’s design office, Zende happens upon Luna and offers to leave. She says he can stay. He notices she’s chill and at ease… he heard she found out who her dad is. Luna smiles. Zende thinks it’s like finding out she’s a real-life princess. Luna admits it’s all very new to her, but the most mind-blowing part of it all is being part of a big family. Zende agrees; big families are awesome. They go over Poppy finally telling her what she wanted to know and Li administering the paternity test. Luna says she and Bill can finally get to know each other. Her mother would put it off whenever she brought it up for years. She always thought her dad was dead, but it turns out he’s very much alive.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Cheating scandal will have epic fallout</a></p><p>At Il Giardino, Finn tells Deacon and Hollis that a toxicology report is still in progress on Tom. They worry that if they’d known, they could have helped him. Deacon and Hollis go on about how cheerful and awesome he was. Finn laments that drugs took it all away. He asks if he had a history of drug abuse. Deacon says Tom was in recovery. He can’t understand why Tom would go back to that.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/De-Ho-Fin.jpg alt="Deacon Hollis Finn B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Bill’s place, he tells Poppy he can fix anything. She goes on about how caring and generous he is. She says it’s a lot… the paternity test, moving in, waking up next to him every morning knowing he’s Luna’s father. It’s so far from anything she could have imagined. “It sounds crazy but it’s like the life I’ve known has died.” Bill says, “For the better.” She nods, “Much better.” She can’t ever thank him enough. “Do you have to rush to the office right away?” Bill chuckles. He might be able to spare a few minutes. Poppy takes off her robe and wants to show him what life with him really means to her. They make out.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Po-Bi-BB-HW.jpg alt="Bill Poppy B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the design office, Luna tells Zende she almost gave up on finding her dad. They go over how Poppy always kept it to herself. Luna says it doesn’t matter now that she knows who her father is and he knows her. She’s pleased that Bill accepted her immediately. There was a connection between them since back when he was just her mom’s boyfriend. When they did the DNA test it all made sense. Zende says family is very important. Luna tells him Bill wants to adopt her. Zende marvels, “That’s great. I’m glad that you’re getting everything you deserve.” Luna’s thrilled to finally know her father.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/L-Z-.jpg alt="Luna Zende B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Il Giardino, Finn tells Deacon that relapses happen. Deacon says that can’t be what it was. He swore he kicked the habit. Finn gets him not wanting to believe it. It doesn’t seem like the guy they knew, but that’s the nature of addiction. Hollis and Deacon still can’t buy it. He was starting his life back on track. He wanted to do something different. He said he was reclaiming his life. “It just doesn’t make sense that he would start using again.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Soap stars we’ve lost in first half of 2024</a></p><p>Deacon refuses to believe this until the whole report comes back. Finn insists the prelims say it all. He warns that he’s going to have a full day of fielding calls and dealing with news vans. Deacon doesn’t care. Tom deserved better than this. People don’t just throw away second chances. “Look at your mom.” Finn won’t discuss her. He plans to honor his wife’s wishes. Deacon is glad he came by, even if he doesn’t like the news. Finn goes on about addiction ruining careers and families. “Did he have one?” Deacon says, “Not that I’m aware of.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Deacon-Hollis-Finn-BB-HW.jpg alt="Deacon Hollis Finn B&B" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Bill’s place, he and Poppy bask in the afterglow on the sofa. His phone goes off and he wants to ignore it, but she worries it’s important. Bill checks the phone and it’s a news alert about Tom’s death. He recalls that it’s the bus boy at Il Giardino. “He died at the restaurant last night.” Poppy gawps, “Died?!” Bill reads out loud about his collapse and says it was a drug overdose. “He died right on-stage last night.” Poppy gulps, “My God, that’s so horrible.” Bill complains that this is becoming more common every day. He’s glad it hasn’t touched his family. Bill tells Poppy how happy he is that she and Luna have come into his life. Poppy agrees that it’s tragic and recaps how she raised Luna in a safe environment. Her dreams have come true now thanks to him. Bill will always take care of them. Poppy thanks him. “That just makes it all worthwhile.” She settles into his arms, but looks distraught and fights tears as she glances at the story on Bill’s phone about Tom’s death.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Poppy-BB-CBS_23d3a5.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Fourth of July sneak peek photos</a></p><p>Next on The Bold and the Beautiful: <a href=# rel=noopener>Katie gets emotional with Bill over his new relationship</a>, Paris issues Hope a warning to stay away from Thomas, and did [Spoiler] just reveal that <a href=# rel=noopener>they poisoned Tom?!?</a></p><p><strong>Fireworks, baby!
