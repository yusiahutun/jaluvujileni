After the NFL star’s unexpected death, football community has been paying tributes to his surviving family members. This article is about his wife.</p><p>Scroll down and learn about her age, job, their children, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Alison Ulrich, Late NFL Star Matt Ulrich Wife</strong></h3><p>The news of the death of NFL star Matt Ulrich has shocked the football nation and fans are paying tribute to his wife Alison Ulrich and their four children.</p><p>While making an emotional post, Alison wrote on her Facebook, “Our beloved, one-of-a-kind Matt has passed away and is in a better place,” Alison wrote. “Matt, we love you so so much. You are profoundly missed. We all want you back for just one more day. One more hug One more kiss One more laugh One more joke One more wrestle with the boys. It seems impossible to do this life without you. Please pray for peace and comfort for the boys. They have lost their greatest fan, coach, and friend.”</p><p>Alison and Matt married before 2011. They celebrated their anniversary on 24 July.</p><p>Matt signed a free-agent deal with the Colts shortly after the 2005 NFL Draft, and he played two seasons on the active roster, making ten appearances. He returned to Chicago after his time in the NFL, where he established a sports performance clinic in 2007. He soon moved to Montana, a place Matt said in his bio that he and his wife, Alison, had dreamed of raising a family.</p><p>Speaking to Montana Sports, Matt also gushed about his wife and the reason for moving to Montana. “My wife, Alison, actually grew up on a dairy farm in Manhattan. She was working on the dairy farm and she was actually teaching in Alaska at the time. So we kind of did the long-distance thing from Alaska to Chicago. And I made her a promise when we got married that we would raise our kids in the mountains. And I didn’t know exactly what that meant. Is it Denver Is it Anchorage Is it Bozeman Is it somewhere else? But the clouds parted and I had an opportunity too make a career shift and move the family out here,” according to Matt.</p><p>After Matt’s untimely passing, the <a class=class href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GiveSendGo campaign</a> has been set up by friends of the family with the money raised going directly to Alison.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The description reads: “As a way for the community to support Alison, Gunther, Dalton, Bowden, and Thoreau as they navigate forward, this GiveSendGo campaign has been formed to help people get involved. All funds will go directly to the Ulrich boys. Thank you for the continued prayers, support, love, and lifting of their family.”</p><p>Twenty thousand dollars has been contributed by Tom McMakin, the CEO of Profitable Ideas Exchange, where Ulrich worked until his death.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Colts owner Jim Irsay announced Matt’s death on Wednesday morning, and wrote on X: “I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of Matt Ulrich. Matt was with us only two seasons but left his mark on many. Great guy, I hear he was a great dad – and he was a Super Bowl champ. My prayers to his family.”</p><p>Matt, who was raised in the Chicago region, began playing football in high school. He was a standout offensive lineman who later played football for Northwestern University in his hometown. As the team’s captain in 2004, he proved to be the vitality of the Wildcats. The Indianapolis Colts signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2005. He spent two seasons as an Indianapolis player, where he defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.</p><p>In 2011, Matt and former Northwestern teammate Adam Kadela co-founded DexaFit, a nationwide network of facilities providing metabolic analysis and body fat assessment, after moving to Montana.</p><p>Later, Matt also worked as managing director and partner with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Profitable Ideas Exchange</a>, a community of “unique individuals with many lived experiences,” including former NFL players, movie producers, and Peace Corp volunteers, who aim to “drive meaningful, intimate conversations among leaders in business, non-profits, and non-government organizations looking to solve their most pressing challenges,” the group’s website states.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Do Matt And Alison Ulrich Have?</strong></h3><p>Matt and Alison are parents to four kids named Gunther, Dalton, Bowden, and Thoreau.
