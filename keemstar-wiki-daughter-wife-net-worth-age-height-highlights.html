The video gained massive views on Youtube, making it more well-known among users. from Youtube.&nbsp;After the termination, he created a new account called KillerKEEMSTER and TheDramaAlert.&nbsp;The accounts have also been very successful, with over 300,000 followers in just 10 months.</span></p><p><span>The channel focused on videos that were Call of Duty related and other dramatic videos.&nbsp;But luck did not smile on the accounts and they were both shut down again in early 2014. Keemstar was accused of fabricating information himself to create drama and terror through the channels.&nbsp;As a result, many people called him a bullshit artist who would do anything to gain fame.&nbsp;Some also said that he accused people wrongly.</span></p><p><span>However, the internet star wasn’t going to give up.&nbsp;The same year, he created another Youtube account, making his fourth and naming it FreeDramaAlert.&nbsp;The account ended up like the rest of his previous accounts, leading to the creation of his recent NewDramAlert account.&nbsp;Luckily for him, NewDramaAlert is doing well.</span></p><p><span>The channel focuses on topics and dramas about other internet personalities, including other Youtube members with a large fan base.&nbsp;As a result, he is recognized as a very inharmonious person among the vlogging community due to his constant engagement in protracted fights and heated speeches with other content producers on the social media platform.&nbsp;Keemstar is also the leader of the Federation of Asshole Gamers ([email protected]).</span></p><h2><strong><span>Keemstar’s net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Best known as a Youtube celebrity and founder of the DramaAlert channel, Keemstar has gone through different hurdles to get his channel to where it is now.&nbsp;Probably obstacles he created for himself.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, his channel was the subject of an online petition posted on change.org to ban him from using YouTube for his racist and trolling videos.&nbsp;He accused people without presenting concrete evidence and based the charges on assumptions.&nbsp;He has also been called a racist, who often speaks ill of people who don’t share the same values ​​with him.&nbsp;He received the most critical criticism of his career by downplaying the medical condition of another popular Youtube star, TotalBiscuit, who announced that he had cancer.</span></p><p><span>However, it looked like he stepped on one of too big toes in 2016 and the repercussions followed quickly.&nbsp;First, his channel ratings were disabled due to his history of uploading controversial videos, but this was later enabled.&nbsp;Also, the star claimed to not have access to her Youtube channel despite being the host and creator.&nbsp;According to him, he was permanently prohibited from operating a YouTube account.&nbsp;For this reason, the videos were uploaded by his assistant on the channel.</span></p><p><span>In the same year, a lot of youtubestars started an internet war against Keemstar through direct videos.&nbsp;The videos aimed to criticize not only his personality, but also his online works.&nbsp;iDubbbzTv was among many personalities who criticized him.&nbsp;The channel uploaded a video titled Content Cop-KEEMSTAR in which the vlogger discussed his issue with Keemstar.</span></p><p><span>Youtuber LeafyisHere and Pyrocynical, who also shared their thoughts on Keemstar, are also among the critics.</span></p><p><span>In response, Keemstar shared a long video on Youtube titled KEEMSTAR EXPOSED Response.&nbsp;In the video, he spoke at length about each of the allegations against him.</span></p><p><span>Despite all the twists and turns he has witnessed in his online business, Keemstar has managed to achieve his goal of making his channel one of the best known.&nbsp;In 2017, his DramaAlert channel was named the biggest Youtube news channel in the world.&nbsp;On Youtube, he has more than 3.3 million subscribers.&nbsp;On other social media platforms like Instagram, the star has 15.6,000 fans and 1.4 million fans on Twitter.&nbsp;On top of that, Keemstar has 73k subscribers on Stream-me.</span></p><p><span>This was after he didn’t give up transmitting DramAlert on many channels after each termination.&nbsp;Even when he created new accounts and changed his name, he often ended up with the DramAlert hashtag to keep him alive.&nbsp;The celebrity who hosts the Youtube channel makes sure to share new captivating videos every day.&nbsp;The huge fame he gained online through his Drama Alert news show on Youtube not only made him a media king but also one of the richest.&nbsp;Also, due to his efforts and determination to rule the online sphere, he was also nominated for the Shorty Award for Best Web Series.</span></p><p><span>Considering all this, Keemstar’s net worth is estimated at $1.6 million.&nbsp;He makes most of his fortune from his Youtube videos and charges $20 per fan to add people to the BlogTV chat as a moderator or to his friends list.&nbsp;Despite his accomplishment on Youtube and the money he earned, people still regard him as a controversial and hateful vlogger.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Keemstar’s wife and daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>The video game streamer, creator and host of YouTube channel ‘DramaAlert’ has tried as much as possible to keep the details of his love interest away from the Youtube screen.&nbsp;He never talked about the woman in his life or his dating.&nbsp;But according to the information we found on him, he is not married.&nbsp;Also, he has a daughter called Mia whom many have claimed to have adopted.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and other quick facts</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Full Name:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Daniel M.
