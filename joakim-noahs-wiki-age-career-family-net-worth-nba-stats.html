Yannick Noah is a former professional tennis player ranked third in the world and a pop singer. His mother, Cécilia, was a model and crowned ‘Miss Sweden’ in 1978, also placing fifth in the ‘Miss Universe’ pageant that year. She is now a sculptor.</p><p>Zacharie Noah, his grandfather, was a successful football player from Cameroon who achieved victory in the ‘Coupe de France’ in 1961.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>Joakim Noah resided in Paris from 1988 to 1998 before moving back to New York City when he was 13 years old. Throughout his youth, he was enrolled in three different schools, namely The ‘United Nations International School’ (UNIS) in New York City, the ‘Poly Prep Country Day School’ in Brooklyn, and ‘The Lawrenceville School’ in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. During this time, he also played basketball for all three schools.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>Noah received an athletic scholarship in 2004 that enabled him to attend the ‘University of Florida’ until 2007. During this time, he remained a student at the university.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=ql-align-justify>From 2004 to 2007, Joakim Noah was a member of the Florida Gators men’s basketball team while he was in university. Under the leadership of coach Billy Donovan, he was selected to join Donovan’s 2004 recruitment group, which consisted of four freshmen. During his time on the team, he played an average of 9.4 minutes per game and scored an average of 3.5 points and 2.5 rebounds.</p><p>During his second year, he was originally set to play as the power forward but was instead moved to the center position to fill in for his teammate Al Horford. Despite this change, he maintained his role as the top scorer and blocker for his team.</p><p>This also led to an increase in his projected draft ranking. As a result of his impressive performance, he was awarded the title of ‘Most Outstanding Player’. With him at the helm, the ‘Gators’ were victorious in the NCAA championships in both 2006 and 2007.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>During the 2007 ‘NBA Draft,’ the ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Bulls</a>‘ chose Noah as their ninth overall pick.

Furthermore, he was plagued by a series of injuries during this period.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>On July 8, 2016, Joakim Noah and the ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>New York Knicks</a>,’ his hometown team, agreed to a 4-year deal worth $72 million.

Additionally, he was found guilty of driving with a revoked license and not wearing a seat belt during the same occurrence.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>He was subjected to a 6-month probation period and was fined $200 for possessing addictive substances, as well as an additional $206 for breaking traffic laws.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>In 2010, Joakim Noah and his mother, a well-known sculptor, joined forces to create the ‘Noah’s Arc Foundation,’ an organization focused on providing opportunities for young people to engage in the arts and sports.</p><p>In July 2018, Noah and Brazilian model Lais Ribeiro started a romantic relationship. One year later, in September 2019, they got engaged at Burning Man. Their wedding took place on July 13, 2022, in Trancoso, Brazil, Ribeiro’s home country.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Joakim-Noah-family.webp alt="Joakim Noah family" width=575 height=300 data-sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>With a net worth of $50 million, Joakim Noah is a retired basketball player who primarily played for the Chicago Bulls throughout his NBA career.
