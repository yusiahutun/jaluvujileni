Although, Larry David has also been causing fits of laughter long before his beloved starring role. After all, he is the co-creator of <a href=#><strong>Seinfeld</strong> (1989-1998)</a>, which is arguably the most successful comedy series ever made both in terms of its critical reception and record-breaking ratings. Though co-creator <strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong> is very much the lead character of the titular series, it's also no secret that <strong>Jason Alexander</strong>'s character of George Costanza is supposed to be a caricature of Larry David himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Seinfeld officially concluded in 1998, fans of the hit series quickly felt an itch for more of that sarcastic and clever brand of comedy that Larry David is so well known for. Thankfully, they wouldn't have to wait long, as only two years after the show's conclusion, Larry David would be teaming up with HBO for an all-new series. Titled Curb Your Enthusiasm, the episodic comedy series would not only be written by Larry David, but it would also star Larry David as an exaggerated version of, you guessed it, Larry David. Not to mention, being on HBO rather than network television, David and the rest of the show's creative team had free rein to make the show as raunchy and swear-filled as they wanted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Larry will be returning to bring even more absurd antics to the city of Los Angeles with the anticipated Season 12. Here is everything we know so far about Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 12.</p><p>Editor's Note: This article was updated on January 12, 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/curb-your-enthusiasm.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Curb Your Enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></h5>Comedy<p class=display-card-description>The life and times of Larry David and the predicaments he gets himself into with his friends and complete strangers.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 15, 2000</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Larry David</a> , <a data-id href=#>Jeff Garlin</a> , Cheryl Hines , Susie Essman , <a data-id href=#>J.B.

This isn't the longest gap between seasons of the hit series, as there was a six-year gap between Seasons 8 and 9 of Larry David's comedy hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-season-12-premiere-on-cable-or-on-streaming>Will 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 12 Premiere on Cable or on Streaming?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/curb-your-enthusiasm-the-doll-jeff-larry.jpg><p>Historically, Curb Your Enthusiasm has aired on both HBO's main cable channel and their hit streaming service Max. That's not expected to change ahead of Season 12, likely premiering during HBO's primetime slot on Sundays and is available to watch and stream the same day on Max.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-season-12>Is There a Trailer for 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 12?</h2><p><a href=#>The first trailer for Curb Your Enthusiasm was released on January 11, 2024</a>. Larry is back for one last season, but don't be mad he's leaving; be mad he stayed so long. The two-minute-long trailer features some great laughs and assures us that the show won't miss a beat in its final season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-about>What Is 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/larry-satisfied-curb.jpg><p>Though it may seem obvious from the eleven seasons of the show, Curb Your Enthusiasm became an instant smash-hit success. Not only did HBO subscribers instantly connect with the overly neurotic and selfish version of the legendary comedic writer, but they also fell in love with the fleshed-out side characters that David frequently hangs out with. These include Larry's ex-wife Cheryl (<strong>Cheryl Hines</strong>), Larry's agent Jeff (<strong>Jeff Garlin</strong>), Jeff's intimidating wife Susie (<strong>Susie Essman</strong>), Larry's roommate Leon (<strong>J.B. Smoove</strong>), and of course, <a href=#>Larry David's lifelong friend in both the show and real life, Richard</a> (<strong>Richard Lewis</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-starring-in-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-season-12>Who Is Starring in 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 12?</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>For the twelfth time in a row, Larry David will once again play an exaggerated version of himself as he navigates the trials and tribulations of his daily life. The usual suspects of the recurring cast are also set to return, including Cheryl Hines, Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove, and Richard Lewis. Set to join the cast for the first time, and likely the first of many guest stars, is <a href=#>the Oscar-winning star of <strong>Coda</strong> (2020), <strong>Troy Kotsur</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=will-season-12-be-the-end-of-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39>Will Season 12 Be the End of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/larry-david-in-deep-thought.jpg><p>While initial reports suggested that <a href=#>the series would end after Season 12</a>, executive producer <strong>Jeff Schaffer</strong> clarified those rumors, saying:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My first season was Season 5. And you know what the final episode of that season was called? ‘The End.’ Not ironically. That was 15 years ago. So every season is the last season. It’s been this way forever. Larry’s put all the ideas he likes into the season. He’s the only one who thinks he’s never gonna have another good idea. So, of course, he’s done for a while. But you know, usually he goes out and has spirited encounters with the Westside of Los Angeles and then ideas come. So we’re in the same spot we’re always in. It’s just business as usual.”</p><p>While this doesn't confirm that Season 13 is on the way, it leaves the door open if they have more stories to tell. Season 12 will be the show's last, for now at least.</p><h2 id=do-you-need-to-watch-the-previous-seasons-of-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-before-season-12>Do You Need to Watch the Previous Seasons of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Before Season 12?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/curb-your-enthusiasm-palestine-chicken.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though there are certainly serialized elements in Curb Your Enthusiasm's eleven seasons, the show is largely episodic in nature. That means most if not all the episodes and seasons are largely disconnected from each other and can be watched in pretty much any order. For that reason, the prior seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm aren't essential viewing if you hope to jump into Season 12 and haven't seen the show before. There are only a few major elements that carry over from past episodes and seasons, such as Cheryl and Larry's divorce and Leon becoming a full-time roommate to Larry.</p><p>The last season saw Larry attempt to make a fictional television series called "Young Larry" - a sitcom based on the comedian when he was young. That all gets thrown into jeopardy when a would-be robber accidentally drowns in Larry's pool, and the burglar's brother blackmails the writer to give his talentless daughter a part in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-making-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-season-12>Who Is Making 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 12?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/curb-your-enthusiasm-the-weatherman.jpg><p>As always, Larry David will also be writing the series in addition to starring in it. Though much of the show is known for its improvisation (particularly in the scenes between Larry David and Richard Lewis), Larry's keen eye for plants, payoffs, and dramatic irony in his screenwriting is still second to none.</p><p>Longtime series producer <strong>Jon Hayman</strong> (It's Like, You Know...) is also returning, and was even the one who revealed that Season 12 of Curb Your Enthusiasm may be its last.</p><h2 id=are-the-previous-seasons-of-39-curb-your-enthusiasm-39-available-to-stream-on-max>Are the Previous Seasons of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Available to Stream on Max?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/curb-your-enthusiasm-the-ida-funhouser-roadside-memorial.jpeg><p>Yes, to revisit the insane antics of Larry David, you can watch all eleven previous seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm on Max.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ksLa%2BwWawqK2iYrKvwMeuqqKZo6J6tLHArKanZWFneqSt0q1kq52cmq60sYyfoKWlmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-outsider-review-hbo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="HBO's Creepy Murder Mystery Is Genuinely Scary">&larr;
