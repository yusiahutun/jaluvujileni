His stay there was short-lived, however, as Spero was employed during the same period as a radio announcer for New Jersy Gladiators.</span></p><p><span>In 2002, he worked as a backup announcer for New Jersey Nets games which aired on YES Network.&nbsp;He was also nominated by NBA TV and the following year he was Studio Anchor, along with several shows like The Insiders and Hardwood Classics.&nbsp;With the progress he had made in his earlier jobs, he was named a commentator for college basketball leagues broadcast on the CBS network.</span></p><p><span>Spero Dedes finally got a big break in his career when the NBA team, LA Lakers offered him an announcer job in 2005. Later, he was seen commentating for CBS for Super Bowl XLI.&nbsp;He became a staffer at CBS Sports in 2009 and was a commentator for the 2010 NCCA Tournament. He was also a commentator for the NFL, as well as the NBA during the 2010 season which aired on CBS.&nbsp;The sportscaster also worked for CBS 2 New York when he announced for the New York Jets in the absence of commentator, Ian Eagle.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Here are 6 facts you need to know about the American presenter</span></strong></h2><h3><strong><span>1. Formation of Spero Dede</span></strong></h3><p><span>Spero Dedes was a bright student and ParamusHigh, New Jersey, and after graduating he started applying for a suitable college.&nbsp;He was eventually admitted to Fordham University and graduated in 2001 after successful completion of his program.</span></p><h3><strong><span>2. net worth</span></strong></h3><p><span>The American sportsman has definitely worked his way up the ladder of success and today he is well known in his field.&nbsp;It is assumed that he earns the sum of $300,000 per year in salary.&nbsp;Further, Spero’s net worth has been analyzed, considering his assets and it has been fixed at $2 million.</span></p><h3><strong><span>3. Controversies</span></strong></h3><p><span>In February 2012, Spero Dedes used an offensive phrase to describe the Jeremy Lin who played for the New York Knicks.&nbsp;This drew disciplinary action from his employers and he also issued a formal apology for what he said.&nbsp;However, Spero was a lucky guy because his punishment wasn’t as severe as other sportscasters who used the phrase “Chink in the armor.”&nbsp;One of those commentators was fired by ESPN while another was suspended for using such a phrase to describe a player.</span></p><p><span>In addition to the above, the commentator also got his name in the dirt in 2006 when he was caught drinking while drunk on alcohol.&nbsp;Spero was arrested by Southampton City Police in the early hours of the morning, but was later released on $500 bond.</span></p><h3><strong><span>4. Spero’s Relationship Status</span></strong></h3><p><span>When it comes to the relationship of sportscaster status, varying opinions have circulated.&nbsp;Some people believe that Spero Dedes is a married man, but for reasons best known to him, he keeps his family life a secret.&nbsp;On the other hand, other sources consider him a single man whose Greek heritage might be the reason why he still has to tie the nuptial knot as Greeks are known to marry late.</span></p><h3><strong><span>5. Body Stats</span></strong></h3><p><span>Spero has a moderate body size and although his height is unknown, his appearance shows that he is not a short man.&nbsp;He has striking black hair that complements his dark brown eyes, as well as a well-structured face.</span></p><h3><strong><span>6.
