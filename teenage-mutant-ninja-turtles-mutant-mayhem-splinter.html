The welcome change of having teenagers voice them and deal with teenage problems was a stroke of genius and made for the funniest quartet of heroes we've gotten in the franchise yet. April O'Neil (<a href=#><strong>Ayo Edebiri</strong></a>) is also given some welcome updates, with the young female lead getting the clever internal conflict of overcoming self-confidence issues to become a real reporter. As great as those character updates are, one character in particular completely steals the show. A fan-favorite icon is given a fresh and fascinating update that will now reign supreme as the best interpretation of the much-adapted character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</a></h5>AnimationAdventureAction<p class=display-card-description>The film follows the Turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing down an army of mutants.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>August 2, 2023</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Jeff Rowe , Kyle Spears</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Rose Byrne</a> , <a data-id href=#>Seth Rogen</a> , <a data-id href=#>Giancarlo Esposito</a> , Jackie Chan , <a data-id href=#>Paul Rudd</a></span><h2 id=splinter-knows-what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-outsider>Splinter Knows What It Feels Like To Be an Outsider</h2><p>In almost every single adaptation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, <strong>Master Splinter is depicted as a wise, borderline omniscient ninjutsu master who commands the respect of his students</strong>. That seemed to be the case Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, especially following the announcement that Splinter would be voiced by martial arts legend <a href=#><strong>Jackie Chan</strong></a>. Splinter has consistently been presented as a master first and a father figure to the Turtles second, but that order changes with the latest animated adaptation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Splinter first appears in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</a> when the Turtles get home late one night after they snuck into an outdoor screening of <strong>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</strong>. While he is still wearing a variation of a martial arts gi as per usual, this Splinter doesn't immediately come off as a massively respected martial arts master. Rather than give the teens a wise, thought-provoking anecdote expressing his disappointment with his children, he seems legitimately horrified that the Turtles came so close to being discovered by the human world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Splinter further explains to his children why they need to be more careful by relaying the story of how they first united. Long ago, Splinter was an ordinary sewer rat, who had a difficult time with both the fellow rats and the humans who shunned and hated him. Splinter's life changed forever when he and a quartet of baby turtles interacted with the Ooze, turning them into humanoid mutants. Thus, <strong>Splinter became a loving adoptive father to four absolutely adorable mutant turtle babies.</strong></p><h2 id=splinter-really-loves-being-a-turtle-dad>Splinter Really Loves Being a Turtle Dad</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-master-splinter-2.jpg><p><strong>What makes Splinter such a compelling father character in the movie isn't just the fact that <a href=#>he loves raising the Turtles</a>.</strong> He also takes several bold leaps just so he can make his four children happy, even when he is deathly afraid. When the Turtles wish to go see the world above, Splinter reluctantly abides. He takes them up to Times Square and they are enchanted by the bright lights and vibrant visuals. It doesn't take long for the worst of humanity to manifest before their eyes, with an angry mob surrounding them ready to pounce on what they think are freakish monsters. After they almost get run over by a runaway car, Splinter vows to protect his kids from the human world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gomd9mczankika9vounpm3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: The Best of the Franchise">‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem’ Review: The Best of the Franchise</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>With a bodacious new approach to these characters, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' is totally tubular.</p><p>Having a supernatural parent figure be suspicious of the human world is really nothing new. In fact, it isn't even new for animated rats in movies, as <a href=#><strong>Ratatouille</strong></a> also features an overprotective rodent father who tries to keep his son away from humans. <strong>What makes Splinter's journey here unique is that, despite being overprotective, he is consistently looking for ways to evolve his teachings and worldview if it means keeping his beloved sons happy.</strong></p><h2 id=39-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutant-mayhem-39-lets-splinter-fight>'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' Lets Splinter Fight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ice-cube-says-jackie-chan-deserves-an-oscar-for-his-role-in-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-mutant-mayhem.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Splinter's fear of the human world is what motivates him to find a way for him and the kids to defend themselves.</strong> A couple of old karate movies and YouTube videos later, Splinter teaches himself and the Turtles to be adept in martial arts. Again, another fascinating change for the character that paints Splinter as more of an equal to the Turtles rather than a superior.</p><p>Once the Turtles meet April and decide <a href=#>they want to defeat Superfly (<strong>Ice Cube</strong>)</a>, they don't tell their dad, which raises suspicions in the concerned father. He tries to employ a more nurturing strategy of getting them to trust him by throwing them a party, even gifting them with cardboard cutouts of <strong>Chris Pine</strong>, <strong>Chris Pratt</strong>, and <strong>Chris Evans</strong>. This doesn't work, and Splinter can't stop his sons from being imprisoned and subsequently "milked" of their DNA by Cynthia Utrom (<a href=#><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After April tells Splinter that his boys have been captured, the protective father does not hesitate to spring into action to save them. He finds the Turtles protected by Utrom's goons, who think that this elderly rat will be quick work. One disrespectful reference to Ratatouille later, and Splinter begins wiping the floor with these futuristic soldiers. Furthermore, Splinter also proves himself to be a tried and true master of martial arts, even using every one of the <a href=#>Turtles' signature weaponry</a> to defeat the goons. It's a rare occurrence when Master Splinter is able to battle on the front lines, and this entire fight sequence is one of the best we've ever seen from the character.</p><h2 id=splinter-still-has-a-lot-to-learn>Splinter Still Has a Lot To Learn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screen-shot-2023-08-02-at-5-00-19-pm.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>At its core, <a href=#>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</a> is all about growing up. </strong>We see that directly with the Turtles as they learn about what it means to be a hero and how they want to be a part of the real world. We hardly ever get to see Splinter ever learning anything, as he's often depicted as the mentor who, well, already knows everything. Once Splinter realizes how much the human world means to them, he also starts to love that world. In another case of Splinter stepping away from his standard position of master, we see that his students and children have a lot to teach him as well.</p><p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is now available to stream on Prime Video in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Prime</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwaaxzZqenmWdqsGiutNmpaKmmpZ6tcHRraOeq12iwrWtza1kppmpnbKuedKpo6KmpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./punxsutawney-memorial-library-experiences-staffing-shortages.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Punxsutawney Memorial Library experiences staffing shortages">&larr;
