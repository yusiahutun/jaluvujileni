He is known for reprising his roles as Xander Cage in&nbsp;</span><span>xXx: Return of Xander Cage,</span><span>&nbsp;Dominic Toretto in&nbsp;</span><span>The Fast and the Furious</span><span>&nbsp;franchise, Riddick in&nbsp;</span><span>Riddick</span><span>&nbsp;(2013), Groot in&nbsp;</span><span>Guardians of the Galaxy</span><span>&nbsp;Vol. 2 and Groot in the 2018 blockbuster&nbsp;</span><span>Avengers: Infinity War.</span></p><span>In addition to being an actor, Diesel is also a good screenwriter.&nbsp;The actor developed a strong passion for screenwriting at New York’s Hunter College, where he received his first creative writing class.</span><p><span>According to reports, the actor decided to give the theater a try after a failed attempt to destroy a theater.&nbsp;Vin, his brother and some of his friends broke into the theater with the intention of destroying it, but were accosted by the theater’s artistic director, who refused to call the police.&nbsp;Instead, he offered them roles on his group’s show.</span></p><p><span>After the incident, Vin became a member of theTheatre.&nbsp;It was also during his stay in the group that he developed himself and honed his acting skills.&nbsp;Diesel also relies on banks as a voice actor.&nbsp;He is said to have provided the voice of the title character in&nbsp;</span><span>The Iron Giant,</span><span>&nbsp;a 1999 animated film.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His twin brother and other family members</span></strong></h2><p><span>2015 was a notable year for the actor, as it was the year he put up with a viral report about his twin brother.&nbsp;Of course, Vin has a twin brother, but it was never his intention to show him to the world.&nbsp;The star eventually offered to share a photo of his brother after some websites shared a photo of a strange man claiming he was Vin’s twin brother.</span></p><p><span>When the actor finally revealed his twin brother to the world, the picture caused quite a stir again simply because Vin and his brother are fraternal twins.</span></p><p><span>Paul Vincent is the name of Vin’s twin brother.&nbsp;Like his celebrity brother, he doesn’t really enjoy the limelight and has stayed far from it since childhood.&nbsp;He was born on July 18, 1967 in Alameda County, California.</span></p><p><span>According to unconfirmed reports, Paul is currently working as a film editor.&nbsp;It is not known if he is married, engaged or single.&nbsp;As a private individual, information about his personal life is difficult to come by.</span></p><p><span>Aside from Vin’s parents and twin brother, members of his family are his sister Samantha Vincent and brother Tom Vincent.&nbsp;Samantha works as a film producer and has acted in a number of Hollywood films.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Vin Diesel Married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Yes!&nbsp;Vin Diesel is married to Mexican model Paloma Jiménez.&nbsp;The lovebirds are known to have been together since 2007.&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Witch Hunter</span><span>&nbsp;Stern and his sweetheart have three children together.&nbsp;Their names are Hania Riley Sinclair (born 2008), Vincent Sinclair (2010) and Pauline Sinclair (2015).</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Liam Costner?
