Some will point to the arrest of Harvey Weinstein (after decades of using his power to sexually abuse dozens of women) as proof the #MeToo movement did some good and started a shift in attitude, but instead of taking more scalps, the rich and famous seem determined to continually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bring abusers, liars, and criminals back into the fold</a>. And now, we’ve seen a pretty accurate representation of this attitude play out in real time, with the vastly different reactions <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between Cannes attendees</a> and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">general audience</a> to controversial HBO drama series <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Idol</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: The Idol’s Rotten Tomatoes score just fell from the Cannes Film Festival red carpet steps <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WkUc4p6Qik</a></p>— Rafa Sales Ross (@rafiews) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=true>At the famous arts festival in France, a screening of the show was treated to a five-minute long standing ovation, leading to tears from its stars. However, its director Sam Levinson has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">involved in many well publicized controversies</a>, a pattern that began well before he started work on The Idol. This included being infamously petty with actors who didn’t follow his every command, creating a deeply toxic and occasionally unsafe work environment, and constantly trying to insert superfluous nude scenes into Euphoria, the show he ran before starting on the HBO series that was so well received by industry types in France.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>what pains me is that it won’t affect Sam Levinson’s career much. he will always have power & benefit from nepotism. he will continue to exploit young actresses, depict violence against women & the industry will protect him. <a href=#>https://t.co/ddMigh1Mdn</a></p>— lilian (@liliandaisies) <a href=#>May 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=897 data-current-count=1197 data-injectable=true>Even in this context his work on The Idol has appeared to be particularly worriesome, especially given the content and direction of the show. The Idol follows an aspiring singer as she begins a complicated and potentially abusive relationship with the head of a cult and self-help guru, and is effectively about powerful men using thier power to coerce and control young women. Although the six-episode series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">began shooting with female director Amy Seimetz</a>, she promptly quit in April of last year, leading Levinson to step in and take the reins. Although it is yet to be confirmed, some have reported the Weeknd, who stars in The Idol alongside Lily-Rose Depp, butted heads with Seimetz and thought the show was heading in a direction that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gave too much to the “female perspective.”</a> Because, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what Hollywood is missing is more stories about women told by powerful men in the industry</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the fact the idol was originally a show that was going to talk about the real struggles a pop star can struggle in their public & private lives but they basically bullied the female director into quitting and sam levinson turned this into a sexism fest…. so sad to see fr.</p>— ‏َ (@filmslashers) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>There were also more troubling leaks than that about the show, with the news that the supposedly dark satire about fame had lots of elements that made it seem like the “satire” element of that equation was missing. This was summed up by reports that there was originally a scene written in which Lily-Rose Depp’s character begs the cult leader to rape her. “It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said one production member</a>. HBO, for their part, have defended their show, stating:</p><p>&nbsp;“…the creative team has been committed to creating a safe, collaborative, and mutually respectful working environment, and last year, the team made creative changes they felt were in the best interest of both the production and the cast and crew.”</p><p data-characters=601 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>Despite all of this, the Cannes crowd seemed to have really loved the two episodes of The Idol they were treated to. And, while terrible people have made great on-screen art before (Kubrik, Hitchcock, Riefenstahl), it seems that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">audiences don’t agree with the festival goers in any way, shape, or form</a> about the show’s quality. With a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">startlingly bad Rotten Tomatoes rating</a> (that’s dropped as low as 9 percent), it’s almost impressive how terribly it’s performing. And, to make matters worse, those who saw it at Cannes haven’t all been so effusive about it either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>interesting <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Eojn6H9gnr</a></p>— ohteen (@ohteenig) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>It’s not just the general public outside of Cannes audiences who hate the show, either. Rolling Stone critic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Fear said the series was</a> “Nasty, brutish, [feels] much longer than it is, and way, way worse than you’d have anticipated.” In this cutting paragraph, he added:</p><p>“Where&nbsp;The Idol&nbsp;goes after the two episodes that previewed at this prestigious film festival is anyone’s guess, though our money would probably be on further downward and fast…we’ve already seen enough to clock that the series has fallen into a series of traps. It has mistaken misery for profundity, stock perversity for envelope-pushing, crude caricatures for sharp satire, toxicity for complexity, nipple shots for screen presence.”</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Other critics reiterated this viewpoint, addressing further issues like “the hideous, self-excusing presentation of rape culture.” One reviewer — for British outlet The Daily Telegraph — pointed out that “even the music was dreadful,” which when you read the full piece is probably the nicest thing he says about the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>oh my god the telegraph's 1-star review of the idol at cannes is BRUTAL <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ggxHaLfivy</a></p>— ash⁷ 🥢 exam season (@yoonminkookiess) <a href=#>May 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=894 data-current-count=894 data-injectable=true>For now, though, it seems The Idol has performed that magical trick of being about the industry, thus making industry types love it regardless of quality (La La Land, anyone?) or the ethical issues surrounding its production (the vast majority of films and shows made before the last decade, and probably a lot more in that time too). This troubling trend is one that Hollywood is yet to buck — for all their slogans about fresh starts and equal opportunities — but it’s particularly egregious when talking about a show that follows a young starlet being coerced and abused by powerful men, directed and created by a man who is known for doing basically just that. To make matters even worse, Levinson is only landing on his feet because he has a famous dad, Hollywood connections, and is in an industry with a culture that doesn’t value its workers – especially female ones.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sadly, as Hollywood bigwigs continue to show how little they care for the people who actually make shows for them</a>, it seems nothing much will change in the near future. The Idol could be terrible, or it could be amazing – but it shouldn’t have been made in the way it was, and it certainly doesn’t deserve plaudits from those complicit in the things it seeks to satirize. Yet it will air, and Levinson will continue to direct — and that’s the really disturbing and sad thing about all of this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wMCnm6Kml2K8t63ToqanZZGpeqStzaecrGWWpL9uwc2irZ6qo5a5rcWMqZinppWZerW0xGagnaecYsCpu9asZK2glWK0oryMm5ytr5Wau26vxKWcm6qZqbamv4yapZ1lopqurbXTsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ariana-grande-coachella-set-list-special-guest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariana Grande Surprises Coachella With NSYNC, Nicki Minaj + More">&larr;
