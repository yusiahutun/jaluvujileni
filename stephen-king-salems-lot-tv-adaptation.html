While <strong>Salem’s Lot </strong>was first adapted into <a href=#>a two-part miniseries</a> in 1979, at 451 pages, the novel is one of King’s lengthier works that is well-suited for a series. The film has been well-received but, like most movies adapted from books, details have been left out or arranged that could leave one feeling that they’re not getting the full experience of the Lot. Its length is long enough to provide enough material for a series but short enough that details wouldn’t have to be left out. Recently, Warner Bros. <a href=#>nearly shelved a theatrical remake</a> of Salem's Lot, but it has been given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a streaming release instead</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/salems-lot-1979-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Salem's Lot">Salem's Lot</a></h5>PG<p class=display-card-description>A novelist and a young horror fan attempt to save a small New England town which has been invaded by vampires.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>November 17, 1979</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>David Soul , James Mason , Lance Kerwin , Bonnie Bedelia , Lew Ayres , Julie Cobb , Elisha Cook Jr. , George Dzundza</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Horror</a></span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>1</span><h2 id=39-salem-39-s-lot-39-is-ripe-for-a-tv-series-adaptation>'Salem's Lot' Is Ripe for a TV Series Adaptation</h2><p>Published a year after his debut novel, <strong><a href=#>Carrie</a></strong>, King laid the groundwork for a format he would utilize for many of his future works: making full use of a small town. <a href=#>Salem’s Lot</a> takes place in a small fictional town in Maine named Jerusalem’s Lot, which the locals either refer to by the book’s title or simply “the Lot.” The main protagonist is Ben Mears, a somewhat successful novelist who moves back to the Lot where he spent four years as a child to write about the mysterious mansion overlooking the Lot called the Marsten House — <strong>a place that holds a traumatic memory for him</strong>. The Lot’s residents, suspicious of outsiders, as many small towns are, are curious as to why a writer has made a temporary home of their little Maine town. Ben befriends some of the locals, including Susan Norton with whom he develops a romantic connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben isn’t the only newcomer to the Lot; foreigners Richard Straker and Kurt Barlow are new arrivals too. They are there to open an antique furniture shop. The Marsten House was purchased by Barlow. Along with being newcomers and seeming to come out of nowhere, Straker and Barlow also raise local eyebrows, with <strong>many assuming that they are a couple</strong>. Considering it's a small town in the 70s, it's long before things like seeing pride flags hanging from store windows would be common.</p><p>But as people have moved in, <strong>others have seemed to disappear</strong>. First, it’s a little boy. Then his brother falls ill and dies, then another, then another, and then another. Salem’s Lot begins to decrease. At first, it goes unnoticed but then becomes impossible to ignore. Ben and some local men he befriends, including the child Mark Petrie, must figure out what is happening and how to stop it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-salem-39-s-lot-39-has-vampires-stephen-king-39-s-way>'Salem's Lot' Has Vampires, Stephen King's Way</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>For his second novel, <strong>King covered the widely popular genre of vampires</strong>. While not the most distinct premise among his novels, he manages to make the genre his own with his unique interpretation of vampires. In a prologue for Salem’s Lot, King says he didn’t want to make his vampires like the wine snobs that so many vampires appear as. <strong>His vampires aren’t Dracula, they’re Nosferatu</strong>. King, unsurprisingly, doesn’t shy away from gore, and his bloodsuckers are monsters and nothing more. <strong>Anne Rice</strong>’s vampires were humanized; <a href=#><strong>Stephanie Meyer</strong>’s vampires</a> were sexualized; but King’s serve only to terrorize.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vampires have become common in films and television: <a href=#><strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</strong></a>’s vampires are prosthetic-clad embodiments of adolescent trials. <strong>The Vampire Diaries </strong>followed the vampire romance craze ignited by <strong>Twilight</strong>. In <strong><a href=#>What We Do in the Shadows</a>'</strong> fanged protagonists are followed around mockumentary-style from one folly to the next. King’s vampires could break from the tradition of making vampires sexually appealing. Both versions of <strong>Fright Night</strong> have attractive men (<strong>Chris Sarandon </strong>in the original and <a href=#><strong>Colin Farrell</strong> in the remake</a>) inviting women to their house under the guise of a good — and unfortunately for them, last — night. <a href=#><strong>Interview with the Vampire</strong></a> depicts its killers as masters of eroticism. A series focused on vampires taking over a small town, without any <a href=#>human-vampire mingling</a>, could be a good back-to-basics approach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stephen-king-the-mist.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="No One Is Better at Adapting Stephen King Than This Guy">No One Is Better at Adapting Stephen King Than This Guy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>From the scares to the sentimental, this guy gets Stephen King — and no, it's not Mike Flanagan!</p><h2 id=39-salem-39-s-lot-39-highlights-unconventional-male-hero-characters>'Salem's Lot' Highlights Unconventional Male Hero Characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/salems-lot-david-soul.jpg><p>Although there is only really one well-defined female character, Salem's Lot isn't just a book full of men, it’s a book about different types of men who are unconventional. King was writing from a place of experience in Salem’s Lot. <strong>Stephen King shares a lot in common with Ben Mears</strong>. They are both tall and dark-haired, and they are both writers who grew up in Maine and were raised by women. But Ben isn’t the only complex character. Matt Burke is an English teacher who proves to be a voice of reason when chaos creeps in on the town. Jimmy Cody is a doctor whose <strong>courage and intelligence provide a form of defense and counter to the rising evil</strong>. Father Callahan is self-sacrificing. And Mark Petrie is intelligent, brave, and knows how to kick ass. They’re men who would typically be overlooked in a crisis, they are hardly the conventional heroes of the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s <strong>the town’s typical tough guys who either don’t last</strong> or refuse to take a stand. Parkins Gillespie, the town’s constable, abandons the Lot and its people when he becomes privy to the evil that has taken over. Many of the town’s bullish men such as Nolly Gardener, Reggie Sawyer, and Royce McDougall all fall prey to the vampires. <strong>It’s the men who are thinkers, not brash actors, that prove any real threat to the vampires</strong>. But much like how schoolyard bully Richie was overthrown and proved not to be the biggest threat by <a href=#>Mark, who is bookish and non-aggressive</a>, it’s the men who aren’t seemingly threatening that are the true sources of mayhem. Strickland and Barlow, whom the town rumors to be lovers and neither of whom exude red-blooded machismo, are the true terrors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-salem-39-s-lot-39-and-the-importance-of-male-connection>'Salem's Lot' and the Importance of Male Connection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/salems-lot-tie-in-novel-social-featured-(1).jpg><p>But it’s not just different types of men that Salem’s Lot fixates on, it’s a book about male bonds. Strickland and Barlow are bonded by evil, but it's a bond nonetheless. Ben creates meaningful bonds with Matt, Jimmy, and Father Callahan, all of whom welcome him as an outsider. But perhaps <strong>the most profound bond is the one shared between the “tall man” and the boy</strong> at the beginning of the novel. Despite not being related by blood, the man and the boy have developed a father-son relationship that exemplifies the need and necessity of male connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This bond matters more than the ghouls that stalk the night. Stephen King begins the novel by emphasizing <a href=#>the found family</a> they have in each other with the first sentence: “Almost everyone thought the man and the boy were father and son.” These two characters are able to be vulnerable with each other. The love that has formed between them is <strong>shown to be the most powerful element of the novel</strong>. Salem’s Lot proves that some bonds are stronger than blood. This would add depth to a television series that shifts Salem's Lot beyond just a horror story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Salem's Lot will stream on Max in 2024.
