Pearson award.</span></p><p><span>Sidney started the 2007–08 season as captain, leading the Pittsburgh Penguins to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the team lost to the Detroit Red Wings.&nbsp;In a series of lucky events, the Pittsburgh Penguins faced the Detroit Red Wings the following year and won, making Sidney Crosby the youngest NHL captain to win the Stanley Cup.</span></p><p><span>Sidney also won the Mark Messier Leadership Award, Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award and Conn Smythe Trophy.&nbsp;Due to his seemingly unstoppable success, he is considered one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.&nbsp;He also has his place in the list of “100 Greatest NHL Players in History”.</span></p><p><span>Sidney has also represented Team Canada on several occasions, including the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2005 Junior World Championships, where he won gold.&nbsp;He was also captain of Team Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics. In 2015, he led Canada to gold at the world championships in Prague, making him a member of the “Triple Gold Club”.&nbsp;He is also the only member of the Triple Gold club to have captained all three winning teams.&nbsp;Eric Staal, Scott Niedermayer and Rob Blake are also part of the Triple Gold club.</span></p><p><span>Sidney then led the Canadian team in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey and the team won the gold medal.&nbsp;He was unanimously voted MVP.</span></p><p><span>At this point, you can’t help but be excited for what the future holds for this superstar.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Sidney Crosby Bio & Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sidney Patrick Crosby was born to Tina and TroyCrosby on August 7, 1987 at Grace Maternity Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia.&nbsp;Sidney grew up in Cole Harbor with her parents and younger sister.&nbsp;His father also played hockey and was a goaltender in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for the Verdun Canadiens.&nbsp;However, his father never played in the NHL.</span></p><p><span>Sidney started playing hockey at the age of two practicing alone in the family basement.&nbsp;He later learned to skate at the age of three.</span></p><p><span>He attended Astral Drive High School where he was a straight student and was considered a role model.&nbsp;He later transferred to Shattuck-Saint Mary’s in Faribault, Minnesota so he could participate in the school’s hockey program.&nbsp;He also later attended Harrison Trimble High School, New Brunswick.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Sydney Gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>One of the dangers of being in the spotlight is that your personal life will always be dissected and Sidney Crosby is very familiar with it.&nbsp;The sportsman has taken careful steps to keep his private life out of the public eye, but all he has done is start speculating as to why.&nbsp;As a result, many wondered if the Canadian might be gay.&nbsp;The answer to this question is “no”.</span></p><p><span>Sidney Crosby is a straight man and is currently in a relationship with Kathy Leutner.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, girlfriend, sister</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sidney Crosby is not yet married, however Kathy Leutner and the couple have been together since 2008. Kathy is a model and has appeared in numerous publications including Abercrombie & Fitch and&nbsp;</span><span>Sports Illustrated.&nbsp;</span><span>Despite having been together for over a decade, the pair have kept a notoriously low profile.</span></p><p><span>Sidney also has a younger sister – Taylor, who is also a hockey player.&nbsp;She was a goaltender for St. Cloud State University in Minnesota.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Home, net worth and salary</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sidney Crosby currently has a total net worth of $55 million and an annual salary of $10 million.&nbsp;He owns several houses, including one in Halifax, Nova Scotia and another in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.</span></p><p><span>With his impressive salary, Crosby can easily get amazing houses wherever he wants.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Teeth&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>_</span></strong></h2><p><span>“Teeth” are always a topic of conversation when it comes to hockey players and Sidney Crosby is no exception.&nbsp;Given the physical nature of hockey, Sidney lost many of his teeth on the ice.&nbsp;Perhaps this can be seen as a sign of his commitment to sport.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Size weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sidney Crosby’s height is currently listed at 5180 cm (11 ft) and he also weighs 91 kg (200 lb).&nbsp;It just means the athlete is obviously in great shape, which should come as no surprise.&nbsp;being a professional athlete often requires training to achieve peak performance, knowing that your teammates and fans depend on it.&nbsp;When it comes to Sidney Crosby, from his size and physique, it’s clear he doesn’t let his team or his fans down.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirmZm7psWMnKmoq5Kueri1xZ5koKGiobOztcSnm2armajBpr6Moaauq5ViwKK4wKuwZqyVmsGpeceeoKCgpGK0osWO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./paul-giamatti-recommended-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Great Movies Recommended by Paul Giamatti">&larr;
