He learned to use it seriously and sometimes raced it with his peers.&nbsp;While in high school, Kevin competed in several running competitions and it was unclear that he was honing the skills that would make him a champion in the future.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Professional career</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Californian started his NASCAR career in the year 1995 when he entered the Mesa Marin Raceway in the Craftsman Truck Series where he finished 27th with the No.72 station wagon.&nbsp;He raced for the NASCAR Grand National Division, AutoZone West Series in 1997 the same year he also signed a contract with Spears Motorsports.&nbsp;Two years later he made his debut in the NASCAR Busch Series while the following year saw him at Richard Childress Racing in the Chevrolet No.2.&nbsp;With each season, Kevin Harvick has improved his personal best time, becoming more confident to compete in even higher races.</span></p><p><span>He competed in the Winston Cup Series for the first time in 2001 and became the “2001 Nascar Winston Cup Series Rookie of the Year” and also won the Nascar Busch Series Championship in the same year and repeated the achievement in 2006.</span></p><p><span>Kevin’s NASCAR career also saw him record a 2014 Bojangles Southern 500 victory while his best wins so far were his 4 straight wins from 2013-2015 at Phoenix International Raceway.&nbsp;He received the SPY Best Driver Award in 2015. For any race he didn’t win, Kevin Harvick would leave an impressive performance in the competition just enough to make it a talking point in the media alongside the winners of the race.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Her home and net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Talk about some of NASCAR’s most successful drivers and Kevin Harvick is sure to be in the top 10.&nbsp;His success on the race track behind the wheel is very much in keeping with his healthy bank account balance.&nbsp;Kevins net worth is said to have reached around $10 million.&nbsp;Given that he won’t be retiring any time soon, we expect his current net worth to increase a bit more.</span></p><p><span>The racing champion and his family have lived in the finest of homes, but it’s unclear where they currently reside as he reportedly sold his North Carolina mansion for $2.3 million.&nbsp;He previously also sold his beachfront vacation home on Kiawah Island near Charleston, South Carolina for $8.2 million.&nbsp;It’s obvious that Kevin Harvick is definitely for the best when he puts a roof over his head, when his new home is revealed, we’re sure to let you know.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – wife, daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>Everything about Kevin Harvick has been racing, no wonder his wife is also associated with sports.&nbsp;He met his partner – DeLana (Linville) Harvick – in the year 2000 at the Michigan International Speedway where she worked as the public relations staff for another driver named Randy LaJoie.&nbsp;She also comes from a racer’s family as her father is former NASCAR Xfinity Series (formerly Busch Series) driver John Paul Linville.&nbsp;Delana has also, at some point, tried driving, but it doesn’t go beyond a toy.</span></p><p><span>Kevin and Delana Harvick tied the knot on Feb. 28, 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada as he made his Sprint Cup Series debut.&nbsp;What a way to start a union.&nbsp;Since then, the family has been blessed with the birth of two beautiful children.&nbsp;A son named Keelan, born July 8, 2012, and the youngest, a daughter named Piper Harvick born December 28, 2017.</span></p><p><span>Delana is actively involved in motor racingplaying sports with her husband’s team.&nbsp;She is also the co-owner and manager of KHI Management LLC, a sports management agency, in addition to making frequent appearances on Harvick’s stand during Sprint Cup races.</span></p><p><span>The love between them has never gone cold, or at least not that we’ve heard.&nbsp;The couple still live together and there are no signs of an impending breakup between them.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGijlau2r3nHmqmvoZOgeri1xZ5knZmlnLW1sdFmmKCdXZ28tr%2FEZqWerF2svLPAx2aZoqeXp66xtNho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brittney-giammanco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Terry Melchers Son Ryan Melcher?
