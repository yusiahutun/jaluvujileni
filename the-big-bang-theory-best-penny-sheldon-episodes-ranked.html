As Penny goes on a date with Leonard's attractive new lab partner, Sheldon goes to the mall, where he struggles to get a gift for Penny. Unsure of what she got him, Sheldon buys several gift baskets of different prizes.

Jim Parsons delivers a masterclass in physical comedy in the episode's memorable last scene, where Sheldon gives Penny all the baskets he bought. Knowing "it's not enough," he then hugs her, the biggest possible expression of his affection. It's a loving and hilarious moment that ranks among The Big Bang Theory's most memorable.</p><h2 id=quot-the-terminator-decoupling-quot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>"The Terminator Decoupling"</span></h2><h3 id=season-2-episode-17>Season 2, Episode 17</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/penny-box.jpg><p>Ever the fan of trains, Sheldon convinces his friends to take one to San Francisco.

She opens the wrong box and discovers letters from Sheldon's grandmother calling him "Moon Pie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Terminator Decoupling" is among the funniest episodes in <a href=#>season 2 of The Big Bang Theory</a>. Penny learns new things about Sheldon, and while her behavior tests the notoriously private genius, he had it coming for forcing his friends to take the train when they could've taken a plane.</p><h2 id=quot-the-work-song-nanocluster-quot><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>"The Work Song Nanocluster"</span></h2><h3 id=season-2-episode-18>Season 2, Episode 18</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-work-song-nanocluster.jpg><p>Encouraged by Sheldon, Penny turns her hand-made hair accessories, the Penny Blossoms, into a business.

His peaceful evening gets interrupted by Penny's scream, who fell in the shower and dislocated her shoulder. Sheldon must face his fears of driving and hospitals to bring Penny to the emergency room, where she is given muscle relaxers.</p><p>Out of Sheldon and Penny's many episodes together, "The Adhesive Duck Deficiency" is perhaps the best. Cuoco and Parsons do some of their best comedic acting, and the writing is top-notch. The episode greatly progresses their friendship by having Sheldon become the carer.

Once at the award ceremony, Sheldon gets drunk and makes a fool of himself during his speech.</p><p>Parsons won the 2010 Primetime Emmy Award for his performance in this episode, and it's easy to see why. "The Pants Alternative" is a showcase for his considerable comedic abilities and definitive proof that Sheldon is among the funniest characters in The Big Bang Theory. His scenes with Penny are among the best in the episode, thanks largely to the natural chemistry he shares with Cuoco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quot-the-scavenger-vortex-quot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>"The Scavenger Vortex"</span></h2><h3 id=season-7-episode-3>Season 7, Episode 3</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/_the-scavenger-vortex_.jpg><p>Raj creates a scavenger hunt that involves puzzles and logic games.
