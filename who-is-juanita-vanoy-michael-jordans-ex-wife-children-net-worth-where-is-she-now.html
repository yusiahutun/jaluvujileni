They got engaged in 1987 after about three years of dating, only to break their engagement for a year before finally tying the knot in September 1989, ten months after the arrival of their first child closed for life.</span></p><span>In the wake of her marriage to the famous basketball star, Michael and Juanita had three children;&nbsp;two sons Jeffrey Michael Jordan, Marcus James Jordan, born November 1988 and December 1990 respectively, and a daughter named Jasmine Michael, born January 1992.</span><p><span>The children are all grown up, they are doing well in their respective fields.&nbsp;Jeffrey plays basketball and is engaged to his girlfriend Radina Aneva.&nbsp;Marcus is a businessman who runs a shoe store in the Disney world while Jasmine runs her own business and media outfit and is married to Rakeem Christmas, a basketball player.</span></p><p><span>It’s widely believed that legendary basketball player Michael Jordan’s alleged infidelity with former singer Karla Knafel was the main reason his marriage fell apart.&nbsp;Although his ex-wife has remained single, Jordan has moved on and married beautiful Cuban model Yvette Prieto, with whom he has been living since 2009.&nbsp;They tied the knot in 2013 and welcomed their twin daughters Ysabel and Victoria the next year.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The millionaire has suddenly disappeared from the radar. She is rarely seen in public or on social media platforms, as is the case with most celebrities who like to keep their fans up to date with their activities.&nbsp;She has no known social media handle to know what she’s been up to.&nbsp;This has many fans wondering what became of the millionaire ex-wife.&nbsp;However, thanks to her daughter Jasmine M. Jordan’s Instagram page, we got all the important information about Juanita Vanoy.</span></p><p><span>Juanita still resides in America and spends a lot of her time working with the family foundation she and her children’s father started.&nbsp;She enjoys helping the less fortunate teenagers by securing educational grants and school supplies and supplies primarily for the people of metropolitan Chicago.&nbsp;In addition to her charitable work, she also makes time for her family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span><br></strong></h2><p><span>The former model received the biggest celebrity divorce deal ever recorded in 2006 when she split from her ex, Jordan.&nbsp;This caused her earnings and net worth to grow to the estimated grand total of $170 million.&nbsp;She also got the family home she shared with her former husband, which was then valued at $168 million.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
