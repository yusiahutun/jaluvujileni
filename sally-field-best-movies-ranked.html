Born in Pasadena, California, Field initially started her career on television and gained attention for her role as the surf-loving teenager in the 1960s hit series, <strong>Gidget</strong>, and went on to star in ABC's <strong>The Flying Nun</strong>. She made her feature film debut in the 1976 comedy-drama, <strong>Stay Hungry</strong> with <strong>Jeff Bridges</strong> and became a box office sensation after starring alongside <strong>Burt Reynolds</strong> in <strong>Smokey and the Bandit</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout her career, Field has taken on an array of roles ranging from her intense performance as <strong>Mary Todd Lincoln</strong> in the Oscar-winning film, <strong>Lincoln</strong> to light-hearted family comedies like <a href=#><strong>Mrs. Doubtfire</strong> with the legendary </a><strong><a href=#>Robin Williams</a> </strong>and <strong>Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey</strong>.
