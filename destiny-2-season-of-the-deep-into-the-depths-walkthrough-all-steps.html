Like always, it will progress weekly, unlocking additional activities, rewards, and other loot sources, while telling the ongoing story of the Destiny 2 universe. In Destiny 2 <strong>Season 21</strong>, we’ll all be <strong>diving Into the Depths of a methane ocean on Titan, a moon of Saturn</strong>. This guide covers every step of the Into the Depths questline and how to complete them quickly and efficiently.</p><h2>Step 1: Speak with Drifter at the Holoprojector in the H.E.L.M.</h2><p data-injection=true>Immediately after speaking with Sloane, Zavala, and the Drifter, <strong>enter the blue portal</strong> at the back of the room to reach a new wing of the H.E.L.M. The <strong>holoprojector to the left of the portal</strong> there will give you a <strong>message from Drifter</strong>.</p><h2>Step 2: Complete the Salvage Activity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Salvage-Screen.jpg><p data-injection=true>Destiny 2 Season 21 Salvage Activity sees you and five other Guardians preparing to <strong>salvage materials for the war effort, defusing bombs</strong>, and diving deep into the Methane oceans to clear out Hive and Taken corruption. This step completes when you successfully finish the first activity.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: Season of the Deep – How to Complete the Salvage Activity</a></p><h2>Step 3: Complete the “Operation: Thunderbolt” Weekly Mission</h2><p data-injection=true>In the first Deep Dive of Destiny 2 Season 21, you’ll be <strong>mining for paracausal coral</strong> in facilities in the depths of the ocean. Each activity is different, with this one asking you to <strong>power a drill and defeat a burning Servitor boss</strong>. Upon opening the Deep Chest at the activity’s end, you’ll progress to the next step.</p><h2>Step 4: Bring the coral to Sloane</h2><p>Head back to the H.E.L.M. and go through the blue portal to <strong>speak to Sloane and let her commune with Ahsa</strong>.</p><h2>Step 5: Speak with Sloane at the holoprojector</h2><p data-injection=true>Back through the blue portal and to the projector to its left, you’ll hear more about <strong>Sloane’s history since Titan disappeared</strong>.</p><h2>Step 6: Claim the Deep Challenger Seasonal Challenge</h2><p>Head into the Seasonal Challenge screen and navigate to the <strong>Seasonal Bonuses screen</strong>, the middle marker above the left Chalenges bar.</p><h2>Step 7: Wait for Sloane and Ahsa to be ready again</h2><p>Time to wait until the next weekly reset for the story mission to progress.</p><h2>Step 8: Speak with Zavala at the holoprojector</h2><p>Zavala has an update, mentioning that you’ll be going even deeper into Titan now.</p><h2>Step 9: Complete a Salvage mission</h2><p>Salvage has a new boss this week, but the activity is relatively unchanged otherwise.</p><h2>Step 10: Complete the “Mayday, Mayday.” weekly mission</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Mayday.jpg><p>As promised, you’ll be going much deeper into Titan’s methane oceans, clearing Hive and Taken, powering and repairing a drill, and facing down a boss-level Wizard.</p><h2>Step 11: Witness the conversation in the H.E.L.M.</h2><p data-injection=true>Return to the H.E.L.M. and Commander Zavala will be standing in front of the portal leading to Titan. He and Saint-14 will have a conversation about Sloane and Zavala’s growing unease about everything.</p><h2>Step 12: Bring Sloane the Coral</h2><p>Give Sloane the coral you extracted during the weekly mission and she’ll commune with Ahsa again for more mysterious lore.</p><h2>Step 13: Speak with Sloane at the holoprojector</h2><p data-injection=true>Back in the regular H.E.L.M., Sloane has her own struggles that she’ll share with you — primarily the sitting still with her thoughts. Listening will help take her mind off of things for a moment.</p><h2>Step 14: Wait for Sloane and Ahsa to be ready again</h2><p>Time to wait until the next weekly reset for the story mission to progress.</p><p>Step 15: Speak with Saladin at the Holoprojector</p><p>Back to the H.E.L.M. holoprojector you go. Saladin has word that Sloane is ready for another link with Ahsa, and waxes philosophical about her state of being.</p><h2>Step 16: Complete the “Operation Fulgurite” Mission</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Destiny-2-Operation-Fulgurite-Arena.jpg><p>With week three, you’re thrown straight into the weekly mission, this time called Operation Fulgurite. You’re going deeper into the methane oceans than ever before, and while the enemies are tougher, the challenges are much the same: banking coral, fighting Taken, and taking down one last boss.</p><h2>Step 17: Complete a Deep Dive Activity</h2><p data-injection=true>With all the weekly mission bosses defeated, Deep Dives now have three layers and three tiers of rewards should you commune with the Darkness lure. Even Exotics are available, should you finish the highest difficulty.</p><h2>Step 18: Witness the Conversation between Drifter and Saladin in the H.E.L.M.</h2><p>Back in front of the H.E.L.M. portal, Saladin and the Drifter have a brief conversation about Sloane, Drifter’s past, and a few other details.</p><h2>Step 19: Bring the Coral to Sloane</h2><p data-injection=true>Head through the portal to Titan and listen to the commune between Sloane and Ahsa. There are some juicy Final Shape details coming into focus.</p><h2>Step 20: Speak with Sloane at the Holoprojector</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Sloane-Holoprojector.jpg><p data-injection=true>Sloane is starting to get a clearer picture of what Ahsa has to say, and explains a bit more about herself.</p><h2>Step 21: Wait for Sloane and Ahsa to be ready again</h2><p>Communing takes a lot out of Sloane, so it’s time to wait another week for more from her.</p><h2>Step 22: Speak with Drifter at the Holoprojector</h2><p>Drifter has some words of “wisdom” at the holoprojector and says he needs some additional materials to keep things going along.</p><h2>Step 23: Defeat Scorn on the Throne World to Collect Amorphous Alloys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Amorphous-Alloy.jpg><p>You need 20 Amorphous Alloys from defeating Scorn eemeis on Savathun’s Throne World. Fast travel to the Miasma and wander around defeating them for about five minutes, and you should have plenty. Scorn-focused public events are an even better source, if one happens to be up while you’re doing this step.</p><h2>Step 24: Complete a Deep Dive</h2><p>Nothing special here. Simply complete the 3-stage Deep Dive activity once to complete this step.</p><h2>Step 25: Witness the Conversation in the H.E.L.M.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Sloane-Drifter-Talk.jpg><p>Drifter and Sloane have a bit of a heart to heart over a drink, and the conversation is deep enough that they don’t even notice you.</p><h2>Step 26: Bring the Coral to Sloane</h2><p data-injection=true>Another week, another link between Sloane and Ahsa. The communication is a bit more dire this time, though the why of it is a bit harder to parse.</p><h2>Step 27: Speak with Sloane at the Holoprojector</h2><p>Sloane’s iron will is starting to show cracks, but that makes sense given what she’s been through.</p><h2>Step 28: Wait for Sloane and Ahsa to be ready again</h2><p>Sloane needs more time again, so back to the grind you go.</p><h2>Step 29: Speak with Saint-14 at the Holoproejctor</h2><p>Saint has some advice on how to help Sloane get through the tough time she’s dealing with.</p><h2>Step 30: Check in with Drifter at the Holoprojector</h2><p data-injection=true>Drifter sends a note about ongoing plans through the Holoprojector, says he needs the fragments of a Hive Ghost.</p><h2>Step 31: Speak to Hawthorn at the Tower</h2><p>Hawthorne has both your new mission objectives and, oddly, more fishing to do.</p><h2>Step 32: Defeat Hathrek, the Glasweard in the Extraction Lost Sector on the Throne World</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Extraction-Lost-Sector.jpg><p data-injection=true>Hathrek is the Hive Wizard Lightbearer at the end of the Extraction Lost SEctor, accessed at the northern edge of the Throne World’s Miasma zone.</p><h2>Step 33: Return to Sloane and Ahsa at the H.E.L.M.</h2><p>Ahsa borrows Sloane’s voice to explain one of Destiny 2’s greatest mysteries: the origins of the Witness and give more information on the Veil. It’s a cutscene well worth watching more than once.</p><h2>Step 34: Speak to Sloane at the Holoprojector</h2><p data-injection=true>Despite everything its done Sloane understands the Witness to some degree, and that gives her pause.</p><h2>Step 35: Wait for Sloane and Ahsa to be ready again</h2><p>Hopefully, with one last connection, Ahsa can reveal how to breach the portal the Witness tore into the Traveler.</p><h2>Step 36: Speak with Saladin at the Holoprojector</h2><p data-injection=true>Things haven’t gone quite to plan. The Hive are engaged in a ritual to send the mission into chaos. Time to stop it.</p><h2>Step 37: Complete the “Barotrauma” Mission</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Destiny-2-Season-of-the-Deep-Into-the-Depths-Final-Mission.jpg><p data-injection=true>One final dive for the weekly mission sees you trying to stop a Hive ritual to Take Ahsa and turn the whole operation on its head. Be prepared for high enemy density and plenty of firefights. You need to kill three boss-level Hive Wizards and dunk the corrupted coral they hold while fending off dozens of orange bar enemies.</p><h2>Step 38: Witness the Conversation at the H.E.L.M.</h2><p>The unthinkable has happened, and an old enemy must be brought back into the fold. No one is happy.</p><h2>Step 39: Speak with Sloane at the Holoprojector</h2><p>Freed of her chains to the mission, Sloane will hold the line on Titan and watch over Ahsa while she rests. You’ve completed Into the Depths.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3782a7a7956a763ad1398a70ac0f13b6?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>John Schutt</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>John Schutt is a contributing writer at Gamepur focusing on guides, particularly of the shooter and Souls-like variety.
