She said, <strong>“I can’t hide it anymore . So it’s time to show-it off.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The pro wrestler Ronda Rousey has become a mother of a baby girl for the first time and revealed the exciting news in a sweet social media posted on 27 September.</span></p><p><span>The athlete shared a couple of pics with the tiny newborn hugging her mum’s chest with only a tiny hand seen. The post was captioned,<strong> “Welcome to this world La’akea Makalapuaokalanipo Browne. You are so incredibly loved.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The WWE star couple had shared that they were interested in having kids but weren’t in any rush to grow their family, saying, “We’re just putting it out in the universe and letting nature take its course and not trying to rush it or put any pressure on ourselves. Just kind of enjoy our time as a family together . Enjoying everyday and accepting it whenever it happens.”</span></p><p><span>Though it’s her first child, She is already a mother, a stepmother to two children of her husband’s children from his past relationships.</span></p><p><span>The couple announced their baby’s gender via Rousey’s Youtube channel in an anime style. They decided to straightforwardly reveal the gender of their baby in a unique way. She explained, <strong>“We didn’t want to do anything that would set hundreds of acres ablaze, or thousands even.Some people are idiots. We’re keeping it simple , we’re keeping it safe, we’re keeping it Browsey Acres style.”</strong></span></p><p><span>They revealed the gender by showing a green spotted egg hatching to reveal a sonogram photo with a text that said,<strong> “ It’s a baby girl”</strong> underneath.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ronda Rousey Relationship Details With Husband Travis Browne</span></strong></h2><h3><strong><span><span>The Couple Are A Perfect Match</span></span></strong></h3><p><span>Ronda Rousey met her husband in a match back in 2015 and started dating fellow MMA fighter, Travis Browne. And after two years, she exchanged vows and tied the knot with him in a beautiful ceremony held in Hawaii. The couple is perfectly matching with each other as their career and achievements align with each other and show how strong their bond is.</span></p><p><span>While Ronda was the first female to sign with UFC, her husband Travis was also a formidable opponent in the UFC octagon. Her husband is very supportive of her wrestling career and even teased the idea of going to ring with her someday by saying, “I’ll never say no to the possibility of going out there and wrestling.” He added. “ I’d love to go out there and work with my wife.”</span></p><p><span>Ronda’s husband, Travis Browne, is an American mixed martial athlete who was ranked number 5 in official UFC heavyweight rankings.

The couple tied the knot in a place where a bluff overlooking the ocean was found on Hawaiian islands. The bride looked gorgeous in a chapel-length veil in a textured, messy-chic bun with romantic tendrils framing her face having a &nbsp;bracelet in her hand and pearl earrings as jewelry. Then comes the groom, her husband Travis was in a traditional garland atop his champagne vest, white dress shirt, and khakis. The wedding ceremony was celebrated with their friends and families.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Married Life Insights</span></strong></h3><p><span>Both the couple posted a pic of their wedding day on their respective accounts.

She captioned it <strong>‘happiest day of her life.'</strong></span></p><p><span>Her husband also posted a black and white pic of their wedding pics and called her perfect in every way. He showed his affection towards her by writing, <strong>“She is my other half. I love you. @rondarousey #browsey2017."</strong></span></p><h3><strong><span>Sweet Father’s Day Wish</span></strong></h3><p><span>Ronda managed to capture a sweet moment and post it on Instagram wishing a happy father’s day to her husband. The video included her husband Travis get tickled by his son Keawe underneath his chin while him pretending to sleep and snore for effect. Then he jokingly chomps at the air in front of his son's hand, ending up both giggling. Ronda captioned the clip, “Happy father’s day to the daddest dad on the planet the man who made me a mother and teaches me everyday how to find yourself through putting family first instead of losing yourself in your role. You’re such an example to us all of how to be a strong, soft, loving leader . You’re our home. You make this family a family and you make me the happiest woman/mother/wife on earth every second of every day. I love you Travis Browne.”</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Ronda Rousey</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ronda Rousey is an American mixed martial artist who is also an actor.
