Truett was followed by twins – Moses and Marlee Mckeehan – adopted in&nbsp;</span><span>2002. Their fourth child was Leo, born on November 2, 2004, then the last born, Judah Mckeehan was born on March 24, 2006.</span></p><p><span>The twins, Moses and Marlee were adopted because after having their first son, Truett, the couple struggled to have another baby.&nbsp;So, at the end of a series of prayer exercises, they heard about a group of twins who needed a home.&nbsp;It was like the answer to Toby Mac and his family’s prayer.&nbsp;So they adopted the twins.&nbsp;Two years later, his wife, Amanda, is pregnant with their fourth child, Leo.&nbsp;After him, Judah also.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Amanda Levy Mckeehan?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Amanda Levy Mckeehan is the wife of gospel singer TobyMac.&nbsp;She made herself known thanks to her marriage to the singer.&nbsp;Amanda was born on January 9, 1971 in Jamaica to Judy and Robert Levy.&nbsp;There is not much information about his background, childhood and upbringing.&nbsp;Information about his educational background is also missing.&nbsp;She is also called Mandy, a currency of her real name Amanda.&nbsp;She married TobyMac in 1994 and has been by his side ever since.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGisn5fGrq3CZp2apZmhxm7DyJ%2BcZpmdlrulrYylnK%2BxXaKwrLHEoZinZZOdtq2w0Z6lZpqZpLSzrc%2BhsGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./destiny-2-vex-strike-force-rewards-respawn-rate-exotics-and-how-to-play.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Destiny 2 Vex Strike Force: Rewards, Respawn Rate, Exotics, and How to Play">&larr;
