She attended ‘Bogalusa High School’ and was raised in Bogalusa, Louisiana. Following her high school graduation in 1986, she enrolled in the University of New Orleans to pursue a degree in fine arts. Annabeth relocated to Los Angeles to begin her job as a clothes manufacturer after completing her education.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anna-Beth-Goodman-1.webp alt="Who Is Anna Beth Goodman?

The fact that there wasn’t a well-known European children’s apparel store in New Orleans at the time inspired her to create a children’s business. Toys, shoes, linens, presents, strollers, books, and much more are currently kept at Pippen Lane.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lylian Heirloom is a French apparel business that Annabeth bought in 2011. The clothing line, which specialises in garments with hand embroidery, was already part of Pippen Lane’s inventory before Anna bought it. The brand itself has been around for more than a century and is one of “Pippen Lane’s” main draws. Eventually, Anna Beth came up with Layette, the iconic label for her store. The brand offers a variety of infant and children’s clothes.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anna-Beth-Goodman-2.webp alt="Who Is Anna Beth Goodman?

John was in New Orleans at the time doing production for the upcoming film “Everybody’s All-American.” In 1989, after a few years of courtship, Annabeth and John made the decision to tie the knot. On August 31, 1990, they were blessed with the birth of their daughter, Molly Evangeline Goodman. Anna and John made the decision to leave Hollywood after their daughter was born in order to ensure that she would grow up surrounded by the glamour and sparkle of the entertainment industry.</span></p><p><span>It’s acknowledged that Anna Beth Goodman assisted her husband in overcoming alcoholism. During a 2018 interview, John talked candidly about his history of alcohol addiction and how Anna persuaded him to check into a treatment facility in order to overcome his addiction. John overcame his inner demons in the end and has been sober since 2007. Anna Beth also helped John to shed a few pounds. Actually, Anna and John frequently work out together at the home gym they have established.</span></p><p><span>Anna is close to her daughter Molly. She pursued a career in film as a production assistant, following in her father’s footsteps. Owning a few dogs in her Pacific Palisades home, Anna Beth adores dogs.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anna_Beth_Goodmans_Net_Worth></span><b>Anna Beth Goodman’s Net Worth</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Official data regarding the entrepreneur’s net worth is non-existent.
