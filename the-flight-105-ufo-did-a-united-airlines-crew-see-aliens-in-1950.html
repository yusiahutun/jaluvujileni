This event occurred in the wake of private pilot Kenneth Arnold's renowned sighting of similar unidentified objects, which sparked a wave of nearly 800 "copycat" reports during that summer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>But the Flight 105 sighting was different—it marked the first "flying disc" report by professional airline pilots. Captain Emil Smith and original saucer witness Kenneth Arnold initiated a collaborative investigation. As we embark on this visual journey through history, we invite you to ponder the events of that fateful day in 1947 and join us in unraveling the enigma. Continue reading to uncover the untold aspects of Flight 105's UFO sighting and the secrets that may still lie hidden in the annals of aviation history.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/airline_pilot_sees_ufo.jpg" alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting took place on June 24, 1947, when a private pilot reported an astonishing encounter. He claimed to have witnessed a formation of nine brilliantly shining, unidentified flying objects zipping past Mount Rainier at staggering speeds, estimated to exceed 1,200 miles per hour. This incident marked a pivotal moment in post-World War II America, as it became the first UFO sighting to capture nationwide news coverage. It is regarded as the inception of the modern era of UFO sightings, with a multitude of similar reports emerging over the subsequent two to three weeks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>UFO Fever Begins</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/f2b21ef2c2da8f65fbec9748da6f657f.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Arnold's vivid account of these objects also played a crucial role in coining popular terms like "flying saucer" and "flying disc" by the press, which quickly became synonymous with UFOs. Between June 24 and July 4, reports of "flying discs" proliferated across the nation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Crew Already Had UFOs On Their Mind</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/airline_crew_posing_with_ufo.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>At precisely 8:04 pm (Pacific Standard Time), United Airlines Flight 105 embarked on its journey, taking off from Boise, Idaho, in a DC-3 aircraft with its destination set for Pendleton, Oregon. Reflecting the whimsical spirit of the era, as the flight departed, the Boise tower playfully suggested to the crew to "keep an eye out for 'flying saucers.'"</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Sighting</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/ufo_witness.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As the flight progressed, co-pilot Ralph Stephens spotted an approaching light source, prompting him to illuminate the DC-3's landing lights to signal any approaching aircraft. It was during this moment that both Stephens and Captain Emil J. Smith reported observing what Smith cryptically described as "four or five inexplicable objects" in the skies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Crafts Were Classic Flying Saucers</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/9e199d78248fc29f920525283c29aea2.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap></span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Captain Smith characterized the enigmatic objects as having a "smooth underside with a rough texture on the top," yet they remained uncertain about whether these objects possessed an oval or saucer-like shape. Notably, one of the objects stood out due to its larger size. Subsequently, the crew observed what they believed to be four more such objects. In the midst of their flight, while airborne, Flight 105 promptly radioed a detailed report of this puzzling sighting to the tower stationed in Ontario, Oregon.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The UFOs Stayed Alongside The Plane For A While</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/ufo_flying_next_to_plane.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In many UFO sightings the mysterious crafts are there and then they’re gone in a flash. That’s not what happened here. The crew observed these mysterious objects for approximately "45 miles," equivalent to roughly 12 minutes, before they suddenly vanished, displaying an incredible burst of speed. However, the crew remained uncertain about whether these objects disappeared by outpacing the DC-3 or if they disintegrated into thin air.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Crew Members Outside The Cockpit Saw The UFO Too</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/airline_passengers.jpeg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Alamy</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Beyond the confines of the cockpit, the vigilant stewardess, Marty Morrow, found herself in the midst of this surreal spectacle. As Captain Smith narrates the tale, the eight fortunate passengers aboard the aircraft had no vantage point to partake in this otherworldly display, as the enigmatic objects predominantly graced the airspace directly ahead of the plane, eluding their curious gazes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Next Day</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/ea46db19964709cc1f6a36faccd476ff.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(live science)</span><p>On the subsequent day, Captain Emil J. Smith's firsthand narrative of the remarkable sighting graced the pages of numerous national publications, including United Press. In a retrospective piece from 1948, a seasoned journalist recollected the event, remarking:</p>Among all the reports that challenged incredulity, none left as profound an impression as Captain Emil J. Smith's account, a seasoned airline pilot, and his steadfast crew... Here, it seemed, was a tale with substance, one that transcended the realm of mere flimsy accounts. The entire incident bore the hallmark of humor, yet within the story of Captain Smith and his crew, as in the scant few other accounts, lay the hint of a deeper, more genuine significance beneath the nation's laughter. These were, by all accounts, capable individuals shaken to their core by the testimony of their own eyes. It was a weighty piece of evidence that loomed large amidst the backdrop of levity.<h3 class=article_sub_title>Kenneth Arnold Met With The Flight Crew</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/d2eb6e2c78587d269781e67f13b470b0.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(alamy)</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Smith and his co-pilot found themselves in a candid moment, captured in a photograph as they engaged in an intense exchange of insights with none other than the original saucer-witness himself, Kenneth Arnold. The ever-curious journalist, Dave Johnson, hailing from the Idaho Statesman, took to the skies in a press plane, faithfully retracing the flight path of Flight 105 from Boise to Pendleton, all the while accompanied by the esteemed Arnold. In the wake of Flight 105's peculiar encounter, Arnold, seemingly vindicated, boldly declared, "Not everyone can be seeing things... I may question myself, but I cannot cast doubt upon such credible observers as Captain E. J. Smith." Adding intrigue to the mix, on July 12, both Smith and Arnold found themselves in a conversation with none other than the agents of the FBI.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Military Tried To Squash The Story</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/410fbf9c714dfe4fa6ae9468cd9fd799.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>by Kenneth Arnold (Author), Raymond Palmer (Author)</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the aftermath of Captain Smith's encounter aboard Flight 105, the Roswell Army Air Field made headlines by announcing the recovery of what they initially referred to as a "flying disc." However, just one day later, the Army swiftly rebranded the downed object as nothing more than a commonplace weather balloon. This abrupt shift in narrative raises a question: Did the authorities genuinely stumble upon a weather balloon, or were they employing this explanation in an attempt to quash the burgeoning story's momentum?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>A Second Flight 105 Crew Saw A UFO</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/ufo_and_plane.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A mere month following the extraordinary UFO sighting experienced by the Flight 105 crew during their mid-flight journey, an entirely distinct crew, at the helm of none other than United Airlines Flight 105, found themselves reporting a similarly uncanny encounter with unidentified flying objects. The idea that these occurrences might be mere coincidences stretches the bounds of plausibility.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Smith And Arnold Formed A UFO Hunting Team</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/a1e0fe28ea926db4c8f3bce9f8d2ea87.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Captain Smith and Kenneth Arnold joined forces, forging a dynamic partnership as dedicated UFO investigators. Towards the end of July 1947, the duo embarked on a journey to Seattle, intent on scrutinizing a purported UFO sighting on Maury Island, where it was claimed that metallic debris had fallen from a flying disc. However, their investigation unveiled the unsettling truth: the sighting was a meticulously crafted hoax. This revelation gave both Smith and Arnold pause, prompting them to reevaluate their commitment to probing future UFO sightings.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Military Maintains That The Sighting Was Anything But</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/project_blue_book.jpeg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Getty Images</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Air Materiel Command eventually arrived at a conclusion, suggesting that given the timing of the sighting at sunset when atmospheric illusions are more prevalent, the observed objects might plausibly have been conventional aircraft, balloons, birds, or even the result of pure optical illusions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>The Power Of Suggestion</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/88885435575a44b74f8a0706d6fa15f0.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Diane Krauthamer/Flickr</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Air Force would subsequently emphasize the significant role that the power of suggestion likely played in shaping the perceptions of observers during the UFO craze. Coupled with the revelation regarding the weather balloon, it becomes evident that the military firmly dismisses the credibility of this particular UFO sighting.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3 class=article_sub_title>What Really Happened?</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/plane_and_ufo.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>Adobe</span><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Flight 105 UFO sighting, despite official dismissals by the military, has woven itself into the tapestry of UFO folklore and conspiracy theories. Remarkably, the crew members involved in the incident have steadfastly maintained their accounts. As we wrap up this term paper, we are left with lingering questions: Could the truth possibly reside somewhere in the middle ground between official explanations and conspiracy theories? Or does the tantalizing possibility of a vast cover-up still linger, waiting to be unveiled? The enigma of Flight 105 continues to intrigue and captivate the imagination of those who seek to unravel the mysteries of unidentified flying objects.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibpae2sMHSoaCsrJ%2BntqK6jZympmeknbJussuinqGsXWZ9dnnUn6ZmnJmZeqJ51KegrZ2UYq6qvsuipZ6rXZi%2FpsOMrJyeZZGhtqa60magp2VhboJx</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gop-senators-call-to-defund-syracuse-university-after-convicted-killer-found-at-encampment-sen-tim-scott-r-sc-and-sen-marsha-blackburn-r-tenn-say-syracuse-university-should-lose-its-federal-funding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GOP senators call to defund Syracuse University after convicted killer found at encampment">&larr;
