She followed that up with Adam Sandler’s Hustle, prior to handling the costume design for the critically acclaimed Aubrey Plaza film Black Bear.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Tasked with realizing Kevin Smith’s vision in <a href=#>Clerks III</a>, Pearce was soon faced with an entirely new set of challenges, as Randall and Dante were brought back to life by Jeff Anderson and Brian O’Halloran. Allison recently took time out to talk to We Got This Covered about what made this project so appealing, as well as the responsibility which came with honoring these characters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-73.jpg><p id=h-how-and-when-did-you-first-get-approached-to-work-on-clerks-iii data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false><strong>How and when did you first get approached to work on Clerks III?</strong></p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>I was approached to do Clerks III through one of the producers – Amy Jarvela, who I knew from a&nbsp;previous Owen Wilson&nbsp;film&nbsp;we worked&nbsp;on together. Coincidentally, her next project was Clerks III&nbsp;and she approached me, sent me the script, and asked whether I was&nbsp;interested in meeting Kevin.&nbsp;We clicked&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;and from there hit the ground running.</p><p id=h-as-a-costume-designer-at-the-start-of-any-project-where-is-your-jumping-off-point-creatively data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false><strong>As a costume designer at the start of any project, where is your jumping-off point creatively?</strong></p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Well I think this one&nbsp;is different from almost every other project I’ve done, because it&nbsp;was so research heavy. I read the script and knew right away&nbsp;that those&nbsp;aspects&nbsp;of the movie&nbsp;inside the&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;store, were&nbsp;all callbacks to the original Clerks. So I had to pour over the original&nbsp;and basically find film stills from the VHS footage.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Doing research on this level, involved&nbsp;deciphering grainy black and white footage&nbsp;to determine all kinds of detail, including what kind of sneakers Jason Mewes wore in&nbsp;the&nbsp;original film.&nbsp;I knew they happened to be an Asics Gel Saga&nbsp;and having&nbsp;worked&nbsp;on Saturday Night Live, treated this process more&nbsp;like research for a forthcoming sketch.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>When I worked on SNL&nbsp;and we did parody, part of the art of parody is getting it exactly right, so it feels&nbsp;seamless for the audience. I think that was my main job on Clerks III, figuring out how to make those scenes in store&nbsp;perfect, so&nbsp;that no-one would question them.</p><p id=h-kevin-smith-has-obviously-lived-with-these-characters-a-long-time-on-a-collaborative-level-how-much-did-his-input-influence-your-choices data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false><strong>Kevin Smith has obviously lived with these&nbsp;characters a long time. On a collaborative level, how much did his input influence your choices?</strong></p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>I think that Kevin is such a great collaborator and he really encouraged me to go for it specifically with Elias&nbsp;(Trevor Fehrman). He reminded me recently that the script said “Elias now wears a metal t-shirt” and that was the only thing scripted as far as his visual transformation goes. That was sort of like this tiny little jumping off point for me.</p><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>&nbsp;I remember after the first fitting with Trevor, Kevin called&nbsp;and&nbsp;gave me licence to really show some creativity and range with this character. At that moment I&nbsp;felt free to&nbsp;try lots of different things&nbsp;and to really explore what might work. Elias has over 20 costume changes in this movie, which is a lot for a Kevin Smith film. Randall and Dante mostly stick to t-shirts and Quick Stop smocks and hockey jerseys, which is a formula that Kevin wanted&nbsp;to follow. But Elias was different, that was a very different character.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false><strong>With Jeff Anderson and the character Randall&nbsp;I think you hit double digits when it came&nbsp;to the changes&nbsp;across this movie. Did any of those have significance for the character or feed into the choices of the project itself?</strong></p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>So all the t-shirts, they’re all callbacks and Easter eggs from the&nbsp;View Askewniverse, which Kevin&nbsp;had&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;started working on at least a year before I came on board. He has two graphic designers that he works with, Nate Gonzalez and John Spreckelmeyer, and they had all these graphics ready to go. When I joined the project it was my job to find homes for them, including&nbsp;specific&nbsp;creations&nbsp;like Ranger Danger.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>There were a whole&nbsp;bunch of comics that were translated into t-shirts and figuring out what colors made&nbsp;sense for Randall, what fit, what brand, you know there’s millions of options of t-shirts out there. Do we use&nbsp;heat presses&nbsp;or screen printing, there were&nbsp;all those different options and I think it was our goal to get every single t-shirt in the film&nbsp;– which I think we did, there were so many.</p><p id=h-what-is-the-significance-of-the-constant-costume-changes-for-elias-and-blockchain-coltrane data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false><strong>What is the significance of the constant costume changes for Elias and Blockchain Coltrane?</strong></p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>With those looks specifically, I needed a jumping off point for each of the costumes in each of those beats where we see Elias and Blockchain Coltrane&nbsp;together. I started to pull from musical&nbsp;pop culture, some&nbsp;references that would inspire&nbsp;me, the makeup artist and the hair stylist. They needed to be visual images which would allow&nbsp;the three of us&nbsp;to&nbsp;put our heads together, in order to create a look which would feel cohesive.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>The Mad Max&nbsp;look&nbsp;and&nbsp;the aviator goth look with the goggles on his head, came from&nbsp;Blade Runner&nbsp;I think. That’s how we were referring to them&nbsp;–&nbsp;we would be like, well this is a Frank-N-Furter look, or this is a Crimson Peak&nbsp;look. There&nbsp;was also&nbsp;a kind of goth murder baby doll that he wears&nbsp;with&nbsp;this big Victorian bonnet. All of these looks really allowed us to visually riff.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>His looks are kind of the joke in the scene, they’re very quick beats and they needed&nbsp;to read very fast, so there needed to be, in each look, a strong element that kind of made it iconic&nbsp;for audiences. I think that they were great influences for me, but amongst the strongest was&nbsp;The Addams Family.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>I think also with those two characters Elias and Blockchain, it needed to feel like&nbsp;Elias was&nbsp;leading&nbsp;the pack in terms of his style that we see in each scene. Then Blockchain was kind of one step behind him throughout the whole character arc. So maybe he’s picking up Elias’ clothes from the day before off the ground and he’s wearing them the next day, or he’s like copying him in some way because he’s a sidekick.</p><p id=h-to-what-extent-do-you-think-costume-designers-influence-a-film-s-identity-above-and-beyond-character data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false><strong>To what extent do you think costume designers influence a film’s identity, above and beyond character?</strong></p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>As a costume designer I know I’ve done my job if the costume choices support the character and they make sense&nbsp;for them. I don’t know that I intended to steal the show with Elias but I think Trevor (Fehrman) really went for it with his acting and he loved all the accessories and the pieces that we gave him&nbsp;–&nbsp;he was really bringing it.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>There’s even a scene I remember, where&nbsp;we had given him these long kind of chain-mail rings, which allowed him to rock out and do devil horns with his fingers. These accessories turned into essential&nbsp;props which helped bring&nbsp;his character to life on camera –&nbsp;it wasn’t just something he was wearing,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;part&nbsp;of his process in creating that&nbsp;person.</p><p id=h-having-been-in-the-industry-over-a-decade-working-across-film-and-television-what-are-the-key-things-you-weigh-up-before-signing-up data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false><strong>Having been in the industry over a decade working across film and television, what are the key things you weigh up before signing up?</strong></p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>I think that story is very important to me.&nbsp;When I read a script the story needs to make sense and also I need to be inspired by the it. I don’t want to read something that I’ve seen done 20 times before, that’s a little limiting for costumes because then there’s all these&nbsp;creative walls to breakdown, meaning you have to figure out how to re-tell that story. I think also environment is very important for me&nbsp;in the design process.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>One of the things that drew me to Black Bear&nbsp;specifically was the environment and where that story takes place. You can draw on elements of, in that case, nature and the lake and the cabin where we shot the film.</p><p data-characters=664 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>In Clerks III&nbsp;the setting is the Quick Stop and there’s so many textures and colors and interesting things in the background, which made that whole space make sense with the costumes. I also think my job as a costume designer is often to be&nbsp;a problem solver, where I&nbsp;will&nbsp;read a script and it&nbsp;will ask me to&nbsp;try something completely new&nbsp;that has never been&nbsp;done anywhere else. Which leads me to wonder how I would do it, which in turn might inspire&nbsp;some ideas that I could try&nbsp;–&nbsp;that’s a really fun part of my job. It often involves coming up with ways to do new things and create solutions.</p><p id=h-can-you-describe-for-me-your-perfect-sunday-afternoon data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false><strong>Can you describe for me your perfect Sunday afternoon?</strong></p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Oh, probably going hiking with my partner Ian and my dog Sydney, then&nbsp;probably jumping in a creek afterwards and then going out to dinner&nbsp;–&nbsp;pretty chilled out really.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false><strong>Clerks III is now playing in theaters, before coming to digital on October 14, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and you can check out our review of the movie here</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeWmq61wdGem2idqJi5tr%2FIr5xmoZ6psrPCyJ6uZpufqMG2ucRmm56rmZy7pr6MmqOloaOku268xJqpnJ1dqa6tt9JmmqilmZh6o7vOpGStZaOdtrPA0mamp2WTobKzt9JmoKKhXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./father-son-duo-traffic-drugs-firearms-get-busted-in-brockton-police.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Father-Son Duo Traffic Drugs, Firearms, Get Busted In Brockton: Police">&larr;
