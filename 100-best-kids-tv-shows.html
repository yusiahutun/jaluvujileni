Unlike family movie night, children’s television serves one undeniable purpose in the life of a busy family: a virtual babysitter. And, unlike 30 years ago, thanks to streaming, children now can binge-watch, just like their parents, requesting “one more episode” sometimes sweetly, sometimes because they’re hooked.</p><p>This isn’t to say children today watch too much TV, or that they watch more than we all did back in the ‘70, ‘80s, and ‘90s. And, in all the ways that count, what makes a good kids TV show is the same as it was back in the day: It’s a show that parents can walk away from, and, upon returning, won’t drive us too nuts. The greatest kids TV shows of all time are those that enrich our children’s lives in ways that we can enjoy, too.</p><p>Here at Fatherly, figuring out which kids TV shows are actually the greatest of all time means embracing several of these paradoxes. The writers and editors of this list — all TV critics who happen to be dads — didn’t decide that all of these shows were the most educational, most popular, or most politically progressive for the moment we live in. Many of the shows on the list tick those boxes too, sure. But like film, TV is an art form that informs as much as it entertains.</p><p>These shows are undeniably good — well-directed, acted, and produced — but they’re also, important. Great kids TV shows don’t just entertain our children. They inform them, subtly, or sometimes, hit them over the head with a message. They stick in the imagination of children, but not in an obnoxious way that is frustrating. Yes, many children’s shows are products, but the best ones don’t feel like pure consumption. There should always be something a little bit healthy in a great kids show, even if it’s just the fact that the show is extremely unique. Redeeming social value is good. Some educational value is great. But these things alone aren’t why adults watch TV, and this is also true of kids. So, we tried to think of not just great kids shows that are good for kids, but also great to watch. Some shows here are for very small kids. Some shows are for tweens. All of them are what we think are good shows first, and good kids shows, second.</p><p>With all of those criteria in mind, we also aimed to have fun with this list. It’s not remotely objective, nor is it biased. Fatherly’s 100 Best Kids TV Shows Of All Time, we hope, reflect the sensibilities of parents everywhere — it’s a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and a few big surprises along the way.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>100. Rainbow Rangers</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Rangers...assemble!</p>Netflix</figure><p>This action-adventure series features magical girls and ecological themes. If it sounds a little preachy, that’s OK. The charm of this show is that it isn’t for parents, but rather, for young kids who want a different kind of fantasy team-up, in which various characters all have powers not that different from the X-Men. It’s well-written and with its share of fun cameos like none other than Pierce Brosnan, who lends his voice as a scientist for the Rainbow Ranger’s take on COVID-19. — Ryan Britt</p><p><strong>Rainbow Rangers <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Netflix.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>99. Salute Your Shorts</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Salute Your Shorts</p>Nickelodeon</figure><p>From its opening theme song, complete with the word “fart” in the lyrics, Salute Your Shorts proudly declares itself as a show that is a bit sweet, a bit rude, and incredibly funny. Set at a fictional sleepaway camp, the show followed a group of a half-dozen or so campers (most with instantly-memorable names like Donkey Lips, Sponge, and Z.Z. Ziff) who were often at odds with the head counselor, Kevin “Ug” Lee. Despite only running 24 episodes, the show still maintains a strong cult following. — Caseen Gaines</p><p><strong>Salute Your Shorts <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Paramount+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>98. </strong><strong>Teen Titans Go!</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The funniest superhero show...ever?</p>Warner Bros/DC</figure><p>Teen Titans Go! is a comedy triumph, one that weaponizes any knowledge the viewer might have of DC comics canon against them and ultimately has them in stitches. In an era where meta-awareness is increasingly a requirement for robust franchises, Teen Titans Go! knows how to have fun with comic book lore rather than be bogged down by it. It’s both a perfect entry point to the DC Universe for new viewers just looking for a fun time and the ultimate endpoint. — James Grebey</p><p><strong>Teen Titans Go! <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on HBO Max.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>97. Lizzie McGuire</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>With friends like these...</p>Disney</figure><p>Hilary Duff’s Disney Channel sitcom still appeals to countless teen girls as much as it did in 2001 as it does in 2023. Like Lizzie, Duff plays a typical teen trying to make her way through junior high school and life, which means contending with parents and siblings, mean girls, crushes, puberty, and homework.</p><p>What sets Lizzie McGuire apart is its effervescent star, Duff, a terrific supporting cast (Lalaine and Adam Lamberg as Lizzie’s best friends and Hallie Todd and Robert Carradine as her parents), and the animated Lizzie who expressed the character’s relatable, often panicked, feelings, fears, and aspirations. — Ian Spelling</p><p><strong>Lizzie McGuire <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Disney+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>96. The Magic Garden</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>More shows should be about people sitting around singing. Really!</p>WPIX</figure><p>Airing on New York’s WPIX for 12 seasons — from 1972 to 1984 — The Magic Garden lives up to its name, a show about people sitting in a magic garden playing music. Hosts Carole Demas and Paula Janis interact with the Chuckle Patch (giggling flowers), a Magic Tree, and a playful, peanut-loving squirrel named Sherlock (puppeteered and voiced by Cary Antebi). They also put on little shows, sparked by what they’d find when they opened the Story Box. Demas, Janis, and Antebi recently reunited for a few live 50th-anniversary performances and they’ve still got it. It’s one of the most unique kid’s shows of all time, and it very much holds up.</p><p>Demas and Janis are planning to produce an animated prequel focusing on young Carol and Paula becoming friends and discovering the wonders of the Magic Garden. — IS</p><p><strong>You can watch huge chunks of <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Magic Garden on YouTube.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>95. The Flintstones</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The bird really doesn’t want to be used as a record player needle — again.</p>ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content/Getty Images</figure><p>Airing from 1960 to 1966, The Flintstones is basically a cartoon version of The Honeymooners, for better or for worse. Fred harrumphs and embarks on doomed schemes with his pal Barney, while Wilma and Betty look on incredulously. Add in loads of visual jokes and punny names — Ann Margrock, Stony Curtis, Mr. Slate, brontosaurus burgers — as well as Dino, the Flintstones’ pet pink dinosaur, who loves to lick Fred, and you’ve got a stone-cold classic. Late additions Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, and the Great Gazoo actually improved the show. Does it make any sense? Nope! But the enduring brilliance of great kids shows is that they’re sometimes not required to make any sense or be anything but entertaining. — IS</p><p><strong>The Flinstones<a href=# rel=noreferrer> streams on HBO Max.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>94. </strong><strong>Land of the Lost</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The cave child is ready for a nap, please.</p>NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty Images</figure><p>Ambitious way beyond its means, Sid & Marty Kroft’s Land of the Lost (1974-1976) sends the Marshall family — dad Rick, daughter Holly, and son Will — deep into the past (or something like it). There, the Marshalls encounter dinosaurs, and assorted creatures friendly (Cha-ka, a Pekuni) and dangerous (the hiss-worthy Sleestaks), as they struggle to survive and find a way home. Bona fide sci-fi talent — including huge writers like David Gerrold, Margaret Armen, Norman Spinrad, and Larry Niven — helped spin the show’s stories, particularly in its first — and best by far — season.</p><p>This is one of those classic old family shows that is way better and way more sophisticated than some might remember, and ripe for revisiting. — IS</p><p><strong>Land of the Lost <a href=# rel=noreferrer>is streaming on Peaco</a></strong><a href=# rel=noreferrer>ck.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>93. Captain Kangaroo</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Captain Kangaroo</p>CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty Images</figure><p>CBS ran Captain Kangaroo for 29 seasons, from 1955 to 1984, a remarkable, legendary run. Countless millions of kids — and then their kids — grew up with the titular Captain, played by the wonderful and grandfatherly Bob Keeshan, who also created the show. Episodes — many of which kicked off with a major celebrity greeting Keeshan with “Good morning, Captain!” — featured sweet stories, visits from friends, entertaining puppets, animated shorts, knock-knock jokes (followed by a cascade of falling ping pong balls), songs, birthday greetings, and more. Favorite characters included Mr. Green Jeans (Hugh Brannum), Grandfather Clock, Mr. Moose, and Dancing Bear; the latter three roles were all performed or voiced by Cosmo Allegretti. — IS</p><p><strong>Captain Kangaroo is streaming on the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>“Beta Max Channel” on Roku.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><b>92. Clifford the Big Red Dog</b></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>How do they afford the dog food?</p>PBS</figure><p>Norman Bridwell’s beloved children’s books came to life from 2000 to 2003 as an adorable animated series (encompassing 66 episodes over two seasons) featuring John Ritter as the voice of Clifford, a massive 25-foot Labrador retriever. His owner, 8-year-old Emily Elizabeth, loves Clifford so, so, so, so much as a puppy that his size represents her love for him. And off on adventures they go, with Clifford’s size and puppy energy wreaking good-natured havoc.</p><p>Of all the Clifford adaptations, this series captures the heart of the books. It’s not so much about the problems Clifford creates. It’s all about Emily Elizabeth showing children what unconditional love looks like. — IS</p><p><strong>Clifford the Big Red Dog <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on PBS Kids.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>91. Thundarr the Barbarian</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Ookla! RIDE.</p>Hanna Barbera</figure><p>Imagine a post-apocalyptic show, in the vein of Planet of the Apes, with a character who behaves like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Conan movies. What you would have is the 1981 series Thundarr the Barbarian, which is shockingly good.</p><p>Some ‘80s and ‘90s kids like to say Thundercats was better. But the truth is, Thundarr is the true winner here, mostly because Hanna Barbera had the inspired gall to give Thundarr a knock-off lightsaber. – RB</p><p><strong>You can buy episodes <a href=# rel=noreferrer>of Thundarr on Amazon.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>90. The Jetsons</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The Jetsons</p>Warner Bros</figure><p>Admit it: you saw the words The Jetsons and immediately started singing the show’s earworm of a theme song. Many people don’t realize that this Hanna-Barbera series ran for just one 24-episode season (1962-1963); another 51 episodes were produced between 1985 and 1987.</p><p>The original two dozen episodes tell the story of George Jetson and his family (wife Jane, daughter Judy, son Elroy, and dog Astro). The stories range from weird to weirder, but the imagery is what works here: brightly lit and straight out of the imaginings of the World’s Fair: flying cars, apartment complexes above the clouds, a robot maid (Rosey!), and an outdoor treadmill for Astro. Is it all in outer space? Or just very high in the sky? These are the questions children should be asking. — IS</p><p><strong>The Jetsons are <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streaming on HBO.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>89. Dragon Tales</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>These dragons want a word.</p>PBS</figure><p>The idea of escaping the mundanity of the real world and traveling to a fantastical world full of adventures is popular for a reason. (See: the plots of many sci-fi movies and shows, several video games, and the entire Isekai anime genre.) The PBS series Dragon Tales remains a wonderfully age-appropriate version of this fantasy. Dragon Land, where Max and Emmy travel to hang out with their dragon friends, is exciting without ever feeling dangerous. Dragon Tales doesn’t condescend or make its fantasy boring — a much more magical accomplishment than you might think. — JG</p><p><strong>Dragon Tales <a href=# rel=noreferrer>is streaming on Prime.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>88. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>George Lucas and his young Indys.</p>Keith Hamshere/Moviepix/Getty Images</figure><p>In 1992, when George Lucas decided to put his wise-cracking, whip-cracking anti-hero on the TV screen, he also did something brilliant: He turned the entire story of Indiana Jones into a history lesson for children.</p><p>Throughout all the episodes of Young Indy, the titular adventurer finds himself connected to various historical events from the early 1900s through the 1920s. One of the most excellent episodes finds Indy present during the Treaty of Versailles. At least one Fatherly editor remembers his history teacher showing this episode in class in the year 2000. That’s right, history teachers were using episodes of Young Indy! If you’ve forgotten how great and educational this series is, it's time to catch up with the Joneses. —RB</p><p><strong>The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles </strong><strong><a href=# rel=noreferrer>is available for rent on Apple TV+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>87. Vampirina</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Are they actually dead? Try not to think about it.</p>Disney</figure><p>Based on the picture book series by Anne Marie Pace, Vampirina tells the story of a young family of monsters who move from Transylvania to Pennsylvania. As the theme song tells us, they get a case of “human race cultural shock,” right away. The fish-out-of-water theme pervades the entire series, making the titular character one of the most relatable vampires in all of fiction.</p><p>The show smartly never really gets into what kind of vampire “Vee” might actually be, and there’s never a mention of anybody drinking blood. But, the series does push it as far as a contemporary Disney series would allow. For kids who are having a hard time feeling seen at school, or for anyone feeling left out, Vampirina is both sweet and smarter than its saccharine appearance. — RB</p><p><strong>Vampirina <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Disney+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>86. Waffles + Mochi</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Let’s get cooking.</p>Netflix</figure><p>Why are most kids cooking shows thinly-veiled celebrations of child labor and privilege? Kids should be taught that, in the words of <i>Ratatouille, </i>“everyone can cook,” not that cooking is a contest in which only those with special gifts can come out on top (and likely driven parents who are trying to make a child star out of a kid who likes to bake cakes). Instead, they should take a page from the brilliantly produced and downright inspiring cooking show<i> Waffles + Mochi</i>.</p><p>The formula is unbeatable: Two muppets representing the titular foods drive the plot (with a kid-life curiosity about food), Michelle Obama plays the role of mom working together to answer the kids' questions (and, yes, offer a moral or two along the way), and some of the world’s most influential chefs come in to inspire, breaking down the origins, uses, and meaning behind some of the most basic ingredients. Each episode brilliantly revolves around a single ingredient, a move reminiscent of Samin Nosrat’s Salt Fat Acid Heat (Nosrat is in fact one of the very best guests on the show). The show will drive you to the kitchen to, yes, make delicious recipes (the excellent Waffles + Mochi Get Cooking! cookbook helps) but more importantly to experiment, something even many adults are shy to do with food. Waffles & Mochi isn’t just a good kids cooking show — it’s one of the best cooking shows ever made, for kids, parents, and anyone truly curious about the food we eat. Bon appetit. — Tyghe Trimble</p><p><strong><i>Waffles + Mochi </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Netflix.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>85. Izzy’s Koala World</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The koalas all have great names on this show. This one is “Chompy.” Or is it “Stormboy?”</p>Netflix</figure><p>The premise of Izzy’s Koala World is simple: This is a reality TV show about a girl who takes care of koalas in Australia. Izzy is real. Her mother, who is a veterinarian, is real. The koalas are real. The show never shies away from the real danger the koalas might be in, but it’s also a gentle show that knows the audience is very young children. These adorable, real koalas may get separated from their families, but there are no real scares (and no death scenes) in Izzy’s Koala World.</p><p>A brilliantly thoughtful and sweet show, Izzy’s Koala World reminds kids that the real world is just as exciting and full of love as the world of fantasy. — RB</p><p><strong>Izzy’s Koala World<a href=# rel=noreferrer> streams on Netflix.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>84. Smurfs</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Which Smurf are you?</p>GAB Archive/Redferns/Getty Images</figure><p>Where would we be without the Smurfs? To leave this show off a list of the best kids shows of all time would be bizarre. This isn’t to say that the classic Smurfs aren’t a tad bit problematic.</p><p>But, the energy, family vibe, and overall goofiness have earned these blue creatures a place in our hearts for one very good reason — we all still relate to the various Smurfs, and in looking for who we relate to in any given moment, parents and children can find themselves. — Harlan Sharpe</p><p><strong>Smurfs is streaming<a href=# rel=noreferrer> now on Tubi.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>83. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Admit it — the concept that giant turtles are obsessed with pizza is awesome.</p>CBS</figure><p>In the ‘90s, just the title of this show seemed like it was trying to do too much. But today, everything about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) seems quaint, in a good way. Every iteration of the series, more or less, is about family. And, the <a href=#>parenting lessons</a> we can all get from Splinter are still valuable.</p><p>TMNT may not teach kids much about actual martial arts, other than the fact that fighting is not actually the point. The titular teenagers here act like teens, so impatient kids can feel like their heroes are just like them. — RB</p><p><strong>The 1987 version of TMNT is available <a href=# rel=noreferrer>for rent on Apple TV+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>82. Ada Twist</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Let’s science this up.</p>Netflix</figure><p>Based on the wonderful Questioneers book series, the Netflix show Ada Twist treats the scientific method like the ABCs. This empowering kids show has one stated goal: to demystify science for kids, by removing any pretension from discussions around fact-based subjects.</p><p>The result? Ada Twist and her friends don’t treat science as a superpower. They treat it as a normal, everyday part of life. As it should be. — RB</p><p><strong>Ada Twist <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Netflix.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>81. Larva</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Yeah...it gets like this.</p>Netflix</figure><p>Like Ren & Stimpy and roughly 25% of Spongebob, Larva is <i>inappropriate</i>. There’s no real way around that label given its obsession with bodily functions and cartoon violence that sometimes leads to actual death. But there’s a very big difference in the <i>inappropriateness</i> of this show compared to so many others — it’s 100% meant for the kids.</p><p>While Ren & Stimpy’s every revealed butt cheek and Spongebob’s quietly over-the-head penis jokes are given with a wink at the adults watching, Larva has an excess of toilet humor not to be subversive, but because kids like toilet humor. The two main characters, one red and one yellow caterpillar, often lean into pratfalls and gross jokes because, like kids, the world is large and scary and when they’re together roughhousing, farting, and being weird, they’re laughing. What better way to make their world a bit smaller, and more manageable? Profound? Not exactly. Socially redeeming? Not really. Sometimes we all could use a good chuckle. For kids, Larva is a laugh riot. — TT</p><p><strong>Larva is streaming for <a href=# rel=noreferrer>free on Tubi.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>80. The Facts of Life</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>The Facts of Life in 1980.</p>NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty Images</figure><p>Although the series got off to an unwieldy and unfocused start, once The Facts of Life honed in on Blair, Tootie, Natalie, and Jo — and, of course, their headmistress Mrs. Garrett — the show was off to the races. The series was bold, not only for focusing on four adolescent girls, but also for the array of subjects that were covered in each episode. As the title suggests, the comedy really was on a mission to teach its characters and viewers that sometimes in life you have to take the good and take the bad. That’s just a fact. — Caseen Gaines</p><p><strong>The Facts of Life <a href=# rel=noreferrer>is streaming on Tubi.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>79. <b>You Can't Do That on Television</b></strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Green slime is very important to childhood.</p>Nickelodeon</figure><p>You Can’t Do That on Television holds the distinction of being the birthplace of Nickelodeon’s iconic green slime. But it was so much more than that. Launched in Canada in 1979, You Can’t Do That on Television served up variety show-style sketches for children, drenching countless kids and a few adults too in water and slime, and slamming endless locker doors. An ever-evolving cast starred in the show, which ran from 1979 to 1990 and gave us 144 episodes across its 10 seasons. Fun facts: A pre-teen Alanis Morissette appeared five times and the late, great Les Lye turns up in every episode (the only adult to do so), essaying multiple roles, including the show’s stage manager, a corrupt politician, and an inept firing squad commander.

Kim Possible</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Eliminate the impossible.</p>Cartoon Network</figure><p>A kind of early-aughts brand of girl power takes center stage in the fun and fast-paced Kim Possible, as the title character (Christy Carlson Romano) juggles high school, friends, family, and cheerleading with the responsibilities of saving the world on a regular basis. Ron Stoppable (Will Friedle) serves as her sidekick along with his pet Rufus (Nancy Cartwright), who happens to be a naked mole rat (and generates lots of laughs).

Doug both dared to be weird (who can forget the rock band The Beets and their hit single “Killer Tofu”?) while also relishing in the mundane aspects of adolescence: schoolwork, bullies, best friends, and unrequited crushes.

The brash, fearless, and reckless cat with a sword is not a character who grows or reveals his complexities over time. He remains brash, fearless, and reckless in the face of his enemy-filled world.

While the Puss In Boots movies are masterful Quixotian cartoon adventures, the Puss In Boots television series (on Netflix, from 2015-2018) is more focused on the joy of the characters, bringing the adventure home to the cat and his pals. The show isn’t one that’s really for binging as the plots are a bit predictable, the villains mostly forgettable, and the lessons a bit thin.

That’s certainly true of the gleefully irreverent, wildly post-modern 1990s superhero spoof Freakazoid, which was executive produced by Steven Spielberg, who also appears on the show regularly as a character. The absurdist parody revolves around a mild-mannered computer geek who becomes a sort of super-powered sentient internet after a fortuitous accident. That means that he’s fast, funny, powerful, and incredibly obnoxious, a motor-mouthed, pop culture-crazed goof who is forever shattering the fourth wall and making fun of himself, his world, and everything else like a teenaged, slightly more family-friendly Deadpool. Freakazoid! feels so contemporary and ahead of its time that it’s honestly surprising it hasn’t been resurrected repeatedly the way seemingly everything else even half-tolerated has. — NR</p><p><strong>Freakazoid! is available for rent <a href=# rel=noreferrer>on YouTube.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>44.

The Little Rascals, originally released as theatrical shorts under the title Our Gang, remain timeless.</p><p>Everyone who has seen them, or watched the well-done 1994 film adaptation, has a favorite character, sight gag, bit of wordplay, or song that was performed. While the 10- and 20-minute shorts stand alone, it’s worth tracing them down and watching in order, just to see the different generations of kids join the gang, often as very small children, and exit once they’ve aged out. For example, Spanky, easily the most popular “rascal,” first appeared when he was just three years old and lasted until he was fourteen and the series ended. For the uninitiated, might we suggest starting with “Our Gang Follies of 1938,” an unusually big-budget entry that showcases a lot of what made the series so special to this day. — CG</p><p><b><i>The Little Rascals</i> is streaming <a href=# rel=noreferrer>on Freevee via Amazon Prime</a>.</b></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>43. </strong><strong>Garfield and Friends</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Garfield and Friends</p>Warner Bros</figure><p>Even at its Reagan-era best, Jim Davis’ newspaper and marketing bonanza Garfield was never more than a pleasant, pandering mediocrity.

Most interestingly, Star Trek: The Animated Series, was the first major children’s TV series to depict the death of a child’s pet on screen in the excellent episode “Yesteryear.” Yes, Fred Rogers lost his fish in 1970, be he himself is not a child.

Blue’s Clues felt interactive and immersive. It moved unhurriedly and asked kids to decipher, interpret, or just guess, and provided long pauses following any questions it posed, giving children a moment to talk out loud or converse with a parent, sibling, or caregiver. A reboot, Blue’s Clues & You!, debuted in 2019. There are <a href=#>three generations of hosts</a>, and they’re all great. — IS</p><p><strong>Blues Clues is streaming <a href=# rel=noreferrer>on Paramount+.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>15. Storybots</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Ask them anything.</p>Netflix</figure><p>The “Ask The Experts” genre of kids TV is too often the kind of show aimed at parents who want to feel good about putting their kids in front of programming to get 30 minutes or so to themselves (while the kids are learning!). The problem is not so much that these shows don’t connect with the kids — there are tons of fantastic nonfiction kids shows — but that the delivery is just so grating. What they lack in well-written script, the hosts, often in a silly lab-coat-looking getup, try to make up for with enthusiasm and volume.</p><p>Storybots instead bring personality, with a funny collection of cartoon robots, each with their own point of view (or, you might say, learning style), and connects them with actors parents can recognize. Kevin Smith, Snoop Dogg, Ali Wong, David Cross, and Wanda Sykes show up as “experts” and they nail the roles, one and all. The writing is to thank here. “All you ask about is cats! Why always cats? Can’t I get one dog?” says Snoop Dogg in the “How Do Computers Work?” If you find yourself sitting down to explain to your kid who that computer technician actually is (“the thing about Snoop Dogg is…”), well, mission accomplished, Storybots. — TT</p><p><strong>Storybots streams<a href=# rel=noreferrer> on Netflix.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>14. Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Daniel Tiger is about to flip out. Sound familiar?</p>PBS</figure><p>Daniel Tiger is easily the most depressed character on this list. And that’s saying something. In nearly every single episode, Daniel has a full meltdown about something. He’s never <a href=#>wearing pants</a>, and things in his neighborhood of make-believe seem to suggest he’s living <a href=#>in a Matrix-esque simulation</a>. Technically a spinoff from Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, the emotional chaos of Daniel Tiger’s day-to-day is much, <a href=#>much darker</a> than the show from which it came. If Bluey is the show that makes parents feel seen (and also insecure) then Daniel Tiger is the show that makes toddlers feel seen. All children do think like these characters. It’s spooky. But it’s also brilliant. — RB</p><p><strong>Daniel Tiger (mostly) <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Amazon Prime with a PBS Kids add-on.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>13. Tom and Jerry</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>We would tell Jerry to watch out, but, well, you know.</p>Warner Bros</figure><p>No cartoon has ever quite done physical comedy like Tom & Jerry (sorry Wile E.). The chase that you get in each and every episode (there are 164) is a symphony of action, with multiple movements ramping up and down, shifting expectations and, ultimately, gliding into a finish where Jerry, the mouse, escapes the clutches of Tom, the cat. But to say this cartoon is all about a chase is like saying Charlie Chaplin was a man who’s really good at falling down.</p><p>Not to put too fine a point on this storied show, but Tom & Jerry is something of a philosophical treatise, a Sisyphean allegory where the roles are clear, the tasks and outcomes predetermined, but the object lessons ever-shifting. This is most obvious in episodes where the chase is disrupted, like in “The Night Before Christmas” (1941). In this classic, Tom gets his win, locking Jerry outside in the snowy cold, and then, instead of curling up by the fire as a cat is want to do, he looks at the door in a few ensuing and excruciating seconds of silence. He is a cat without purpose, and the viewer can’t help but feel dread. Fortunately, Tom shows his “humanity” — opening the door, thawing the mouse, giving them a candy cane, and ending with the required detente. They live to chase another day. What other end could there be? — TT</p><p><strong>Tom & Jerry is <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streaming on HBO Max.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>12. </strong><strong>Doctor Who</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor.</p>Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</figure><p>Even longtime fans of the cult British sci-fi series may not know that Doctor Who began as a children’s program. Created in 1963 by Sydney Newman and Verity Lambert for the BBC, the stated goal of Who was to use a time travel premise to introduce children to science concepts and history lessons. At the same time, Doctor Who was to be a family-friendly action-adventure series, starring a protagonist who never carried a gun, but instead, solved problems through their wits and intelligence.</p><p>Six decades later, Doctor Who has, more or less, retained that mission statement. Although the fan base is much bigger than families, and the contemporary versions of the show are better for kids 8 and up, Who has an undeniably upbeat vibe. The titular Doctor is “never cruel or cowardly,” and even in the darkest of these timey wimey adventures, the series is wise, funny, and big-hearted. In fact, in the mythology of the show, our favorite Time Lord has two hearts instead of one, which tells you everything you need to know about how the metaphors on this show work. The Doctor’s time/space machine, the TARDIS, is “bigger on the inside,” and over the years Doctor Who has proven to be capacious enough to take several generations of fans along for the journey. If you give Who a closer look through the eyes of a parent, you can see why Disney+ snatching it up for 2023 makes perfect sense. — RB</p><p><b><i>Doctor Who </i></b><b>is currently streaming on </b><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer>HBO Max</a></b><b> and </b><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer>BritBox</a></b><b>.

Those are the ingredients that created The Powerpuff Girls, an immensely stylized and smart take on superpowers and girl power.

But, the 2017-2019 TV series nearly matches the brilliance of the first 13 books with one simple trick: While most adaptations of great children’s literature tend to condense, the TV version of Unfortunate Events actually managed to expand the Baudelaire saga and give us characters and scenes that were impossible to depict in the books.</p><p>The wit, style, intelligence, and pure originality of this series may never be topped. The only real negative thing to say about it is that the fact that hews so closely to the story of the 13 original books, means, there was never going to be a season 4. Certainly not for young kids, but your older kids are gonna love it. And, even if they don’t, you can just watch it by yourself.

Featuring a crew of brave explorers — who all just happen to be talking animals — the Octonauts travel the world in their undersea ship, the Octopod. With a musical score equal parts John Barry’s 007 and Michael Giacchino’s The Incredibles, the name of the game here is adventure above all. Each character has a catchphrase that is somehow not annoying, which blends well with a format that mixes the best elements of Star Trek, Voltron, and Thunderbirds. On top of that, The Octonauts is 100 percent non-violent and incredibly educational. Via “Creature Reports” (and later, “OctoReports”) we learn about various animal life, natural phenomenon, and more. The Octonauts is a show with a conscience that is never preachy. It’s also full of wit without resorting to banal “quirkiness,” a true rarity among contemporary kids' shows. The only thing bad about this show is that parents will wish it existed when they were in preschool, too. — RB</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Octonauts </a>and its various <a href=# rel=noreferrer>standalone</a> movies<a href=# rel=noreferrer> all stream on Netflix.</a> The spinoff show, which is nearly the exact format, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Octonauts: Above and Beyond</a> also streams on Netflix.</strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>8. Pee-wee’s Playhouse</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Paul Reubens in Pee Wee’s Playhouse.</p>John Kisch Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images</figure><p>When Pee-wee Herman invited viewers into his kaleidoscopic playhouse in the fall of 1986, the show was the only program on CBS’s Saturday morning children’s television lineup that wasn’t entirely animated. Luckily, Pee-wee and his human friends (like the mildly-flirtatious Miss Yvonne and disembodied head, Jambi the Genie) were like cartoon characters brought to life. Paul Reubens (the Clark Kent to Pee-wee Herman’s Superman) broke the children’s television mold by creating a show that was as innovative as it was retro and familiar as it was unique. Where else could you see someone jump inside of a puppet, like the Magic Screen, make a spaceship by playing connect the dots, and then flying into space… just moments before or after watching a classic cartoon from the 1940s. Week after week, Pee-wee encouraged kids to be creative, take up space (sometimes just by screaming “real loud” at the secret word), and be the best friend—and version of themselves—that they could be.</p><p>It was a place where “anything can happen,” as Cyndi Lauper sings in the theme song, and where everyone is welcome. For all of Playhouse’s crowning achievements, perhaps one of its most significant was creating a truly inclusive environment. The 1988 prime-time Christmas Special featured a segment on Hanukkah and Black actors like Laurence Fishburne (back when he was Larry), S. Epatha Merkerson, Gilbert Lewis, and William Marshall were series regulars. The show was set in the fictional Puppetland, but things would be much more fun if the real world was like the one Pee-wee lived in. — CG</p><p><b><i>Pee Wee's Playhouse </i>is available for rent <a href=# rel=noreferrer>on YouTube</a>.</b></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>7.

The Kratt Brothers — Chris and Martin — celebrate the superpowers of animals with a show that’s half animal documentary, half cartoon adventure.</p><p>Wild Kratts! the longest-running series from these real-life zoologists (the Kratt brothers also created Kratt’s Creatures, Zoboomafoo) has such staying power because of an ingenious formula. This is a show that shines a light on the badass side of all creatures great and small, explores the fragility of the natural world, and then satisfyingly takes down ecological villains all in a tightly packed 25 minutes. — JG</p><p><strong>Wild Kratts! streams on <a href=# rel=noreferrer>PBS Kids via Amazon Prime.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>6. </strong><strong>Dora the Explorer</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Seriously, Swiper.

Reading Rainbow</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>LeVar Burton in 'Reading Rainbow.'</p>PBS</figure><p><a href=#>LeVar Burton</a> can lay claim to three remarkable and career-defining television roles: Kunta Kinte in Roots, a decades-long long stint as Geordi La Forge in Star Trek: The Next Generation (and its movies and spin-offs), and his work as the creator/host of Reading Rainbow. For more than 20 years as a show (1983-2006) and now as an app, Burton and Reading Rainbow encouraged kids to, yes, read, read read — but also to take the lessons from books and apply them to the real world in order to more fully experience life.</p><p>Most episodes of Reading Rainbow took a page from Mister Rogers’ factory tours: Burton would visit a place — a bowling alley in Ohio or the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC., or the sandy beaches of Sanibel Island in Florida — and talk to an expert there about how that place is meaningful. The episode would then be brought together with a lesson gleaned from a picture book, read by narrators who reflected Burton’s career and personal favorites including Ruby Dee, Patrick Stewart, Alfre Woodard, Pete Seeger, Julia Child, Raul Julia, and James Earl Jones. Like Mister Rogers, the pace is slow, careful, and deliberate — just right for young minds. But Burton relied more heavily on his settings and guests to bring the real world to the kids. The many voices from each episode — of narrator, author, experts, alongside Burton — completed the promise of the theme song, brilliantly sung by Chaka Khan, that “I can go anywhere” with “friends to know, and ways to grow.” That’s Reading Rainbow. — IS</p><p><strong>Reading Rainbow <a href=# rel=noreferrer>streams on Amazon Prime.</a></strong></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>3. </strong><strong>Bluey</strong></h2></p><figure class="Qf5 CMk"><p>Bandit really gets into it.</p>ABC/Disney+</figure><p>It’s popular to say that Bluey is so huge because it captures the actual experience of parents trying desperately to entertain their children.

What began as a program to supplement the education of Black and brown kids in America’s cities has grown into an internationally-recognized phenomenon, beloved by kids and adults the world over. Sesame Street’s strength is in its fun, varied, and holistic view of learning. In one segment, you can see a comedic musical vignette with a human teaching a Muppet how to tie their shoelace, and then a moment later, see an animated spot about counting to twelve. It was diverse in the way it approached edutainment, and also in the way it approached humanity—even if often expressed through Muppets like Big Bird, Grover, Telly, Elmo, Bert and Ernie, and the many others that have graced our screens over the last half-century. Sesame Street paints an idyllic neighborhood where people talk through their feelings, often with others who look nothing like them.</p><p>It’s impossible to estimate how many people were positively impacted by getting to meet Latinx characters like Luis and Maria, Black characters like Gordon and Olivia, deaf actress Linda Bove, and celebrity guests from different cultures and walks of life who passed through the Street in each episode. Every once in a while criticism springs up about the show — “It was better when I was a kid!” — but those sentiments are really about how attached we all feel to our childhood memories of sitting on the floor while laughing and learning, along with our favorite characters. No matter how old we get, a small part of us will always want to know how we can get (back) to Sesame Street. — CG.</p><p><b><i>Sesame Street</i> streams on <a href=# rel=noreferrer>HBO Max</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>PBS Kids</a>.</b></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p z6x"><strong>1.
