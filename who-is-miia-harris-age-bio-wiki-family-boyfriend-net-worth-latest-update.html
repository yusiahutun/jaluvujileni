Miia had the honour of attending the Kid’s Choice Awards sponsored by Nickelodeon on April 12, 2022.</span></p><p><span>Harris knows acting is a tough path. As her career starts to take off, she offers this advice to others considering acting: “My parents did a pretty good job of keeping it real with me. … I think I just always loved it so, so much that I was like I just don’t think there’s anything else I could do, even if it never works out.”</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Miia-Harris-2.webp alt="Who Is Miia Harris?
