She was not only packed with talent but also her personality stood out from the rest of the newbies featured this season.</span></p><p><span>So, who is she? Keep reading this Hope Giselle Bio to learn all about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Hope Giselle On I Am Jazz</b></h3><p><i><span>I Am Jazz</span></i><span> season 7 premiered on November 30, 2021, and the fans were introduced to a new cast, Hope Giselle. She came into the scene as the first transgender person Jazz Jennings’s bother ever dated. It seems that besides helping his sister, Sander was also fulfilling his own life, such as going on an ice skating date with Hope.</span></p><p><span>This 11-part series was filmed five days a week, including both days on the weekend. If you don’t know the show was initially called </span><i><span>All That Jazz</span></i><span> but was retitled to </span><i><span>I Am Jazz</span></i><span>. It was all about Jazz and her family “dealing with typical teen drama through the lens of a transgender youth.”</span></p><h3><b>Are Hope Giselle And Sander Jennings Still Dating?</b></h3><p><span>No, as of 2021, Hope Giselle and Sander Jennings didn’t seem like they were dating anymore.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Although the two appeared to hit it off during their date on </span><i><span>I Am Jazz</span></i><span>, Sander later goes on to reveal to his friend that he isn’t sure if he could sleep with someone without the below surgery. However, the two didn’t officially reveal any information about their relationships. But that could just be their TLC contract, keeping their lips shut.</span></p><p><span>Also, Hope’s FB relationship status then labeled her as “single.” So, the pair’s relationship probably never bloomed.</span></p><p><span>But did you know? Hope already had a special person in her life whom she labeled as her “best friend, brother, security, husband, and therapist.” He is the international hair and makeup artist Jayson Glenn @</span><a href=#><span>mr.jglenn</span></a><span>. The two were often featured over Hope’s IG, and anyone who didn’t know would label them as couples.</span></p><p><span>Well, given the pictures of them often in each other arms, moreover, with all lovey-dovey captions, they did look like partners. An IG pic from April 2021, with Hope tightly hugging Jayson, was captioned, “If you don’t love me this much I don’t want it!”</span></p><p><span>The definition of love is different from person to person, and this was how Hope defined it — “Love isn’t always romantic, but it always requires patience and choosing to be there because your spirit draws you in and your heart plays the soundtrack of the room.”</span></p><h3><b>Hope Giselle Age</b></h3><p><span>Hope Giselle was born on August 2, 1993.

Other than that, there’s no before for her.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Whenever Hope felt down or sick, she’d turn to her family and everything would be all right. “Family is medicine when I’m down,” she said.</span></p><h3><b>Is Hope Giselle On Twitter, Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, find her over Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>HopeDisguised</span></a><span>, and Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>hopegiselle</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s her Facebook page @</span><a href=#><span>hope.disguised</span></a><span>, and her </span><a href=#><span>private FB</span></a><span> account.</span></p><p><span>Subscribe to her Youtube @</span><a href=#><span>HopeDisguised</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Hope Giselle Career</b></h3><p><span>Hope Giselle has stepped into multiple careers.
