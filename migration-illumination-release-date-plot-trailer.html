From the hilarious and lovable minions of <strong>Despicable Me</strong> to <a href=#>the zany animal characters of <strong>Sing</strong></a>, Illumination's movies have a way of bringing out the childlike wonder in all of us. And it's not just children who are drawn to animated movies - adults love them too. Illumination’s most recent film, <strong><a href=#>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> </strong>expands upon the familiar Mushroom Kingdom and its inhabitants, introducing new elements and characters that surely are a delight to fans. And for those who grew up playing the classic games, there are plenty of nods and references to previous titles, from the iconic music to the witty in-game dialogue, giving adults the chance to not only appreciate it but also share it with their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But that is not the only release families can expect from the studio and our excitement is only bound to increase as Illumination Studios will soon be releasing their next anticipated movie <strong>Migration</strong>. This animated adventure comedy promises to be another hit for the studio, as it explores themes of courage, stepping out of your comfort zone, and the importance of family.</p><p>Editor's Note: This piece was updated on December 7, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/migration-film-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Migration>Migration</a></h5>PGAnimationActionAdventure<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>December 22, 2023</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Benjamin Renner , Guylo Homsy</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Elizabeth Banks</a> , <a data-id href=#>Awkwafina</a> , Danny DeVito , <a data-id href=#>Carol Kane</a> , <a data-id href=#>Kumail Nanjiani</a> , <a data-id href=#>Keegan Michael Key</a> , David Mitchell</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Animation</a></span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Benjamin Renner , Mike White</span> <strong>Studio(s)</strong> <span>Illumination Entertainment</span> <strong>Distributor(s)</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Universal Pictures</a></span> Expand <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-and-where-is-39-migration-39-releasing>When and Where Is 'Migration' Releasing?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/migration-animated-movie-images-featured.jpg><p>Universal made a surprising move in June 2022 when it shifted the release date of Migration from a summer 2023 debut to a winter holiday release. Although this may seem like an unusual decision given the film's premise, it could be a smart move to capitalize on audiences' desire for summertime entertainment during the winter months.</p><p>Migration is now scheduled to hit theaters on December 22, 2023, amid a month filled with big-budget releases from major studios. On its current date, the film will be opening up against the DC superhero sequel <strong>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</strong>, the wrestling drama <strong>The Iron Claw</strong>, and the R-rated romantic comedy<strong> Anyone But You</strong>. Although its most direction competition comes a week prior with the big-budget family musical <strong>Wonka</strong> starring<strong> Timothée Chalamet</strong> as <strong>Roald Dahl</strong>'s most iconic character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The release of Migration during the winter holiday season will be a noteworthy event for Illumination Studios as it will be the first time since 2016 that the company will have released two films in the same year (namely, The Secret Life of Pets and Sing). <a href=#>After the massive success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie at the box office</a> and the success of <strong>Minions: The Rise of Gru</strong> in the summer of 2022, Illumination is looking more prominent than ever. A strong theatrical run by Migration could further solidify Illumination's position as the most successful U.S. feature animation studio in recent years.</p><h2 id=will-39-migration-39-be-available-to-stream>Will 'Migration' be Available to Stream?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/migration-movie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Migration will initially be released exclusively in movie theaters. A streaming date won't be known until a few weeks after the film has hit the big screen. When the film eventually does release on streaming, it will be made available to Peacock subscribers, following in line with other recent releases from Illumination and DreamWorks including <strong>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</strong> and <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>. The film will then head to Netflix once it leaves Peacock.</p><h2 id=is-there-a-trailer-for-39-migration-39>Is There a Trailer for 'Migration'?</h2><p><a href=#>An announcement teaser for </a><a href=#>Migration</a> was released on April 5, coinciding with the release of The Super Mario Bros Movie. While the teaser may not give us much insight into the plot, it still manages to showcase Illumination's trademark quality of animation. The brief animation in the trailer looks sharp, and the jokes all seem to hit the mark. Clocking in at just under two minutes, the teaser initially dedicates the first minute to highlighting Illumination's impressive catalog of successful animated properties, before revealing the heroes of Migration, a family of ducks, who are getting ready to fly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The<a href=#> full trailer for Migration</a> was released by Illumination on July 18, 2023, and gives audiences a much better look at the film's story, as the Mallard family's migration to Jamaica takes a radical detour through New York City.</p><p>The <a href=#>second trailer for Migration</a> was released on October 14 and featured<strong> Taylor Swift'</strong>s re-recording of her song "Out of the Woods," in honor of the release of <strong>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>third trailer for</a><a href=#> Migration</a> was released online on November 14.

With Migration set to hit theaters very soon, it's clear that the studio has no plans of slowing down.</p><p>Migration is a heartwarming story of family, adventure, and the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone. The animated movie follows a family of ducks as they embark on an epic journey from New England to the Bahamas, a trip that promises to be the ultimate vacation experience. However, the journey isn't just about leisurely flight and fun in the sun. The ducks must overcome numerous obstacles along the way, including thunderstorms, unfamiliar species of birds, and other hazards that threaten their very survival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what we know of the plot, one of the central themes of Migration is the importance of courage and perseverance. The younger ducks in the family must convince their overprotective father to take the trip, despite his reservations and concerns about their safety. Through their bravery, determination, and desire to explore, the young ducks demonstrate that sometimes, the greatest adventures in life require us to take risks and step outside our comfort zones.</p><p>As with other Illumination Studio productions, Migration promises to be a visually stunning and entertaining film that will delight audiences of all ages. With its compelling storyline, memorable characters, and impressive animation, the movie is sure to be a hit!</p><p>Here is the official synopsis:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This holiday season, Illumination, creators of the blockbuster Minions, Despicable Me, Sing and The Secret Life of Pets comedies, invites you to take flight into the thrill of the unknown with a funny, feathered family vacation like no other in the action-packed new original comedy, Migration.</p><p>The Mallard family is in a bit of rut. While dad Mack is content to keep his family safe paddling around their New England pond forever, mom Pam is eager to shake things up and show their kids—teen son Dax and duckling daughter Gwen—the whole wide world. After a migrating duck family alights on their pond with thrilling tales of far-flung places, Pam persuades Mack to embark on a family trip, via New York City, to tropical Jamaica.</p><p>As the Mallards make their way South for the winter, their well-laid plans quickly go awry. The experience will inspire them to expand their horizons, open themselves up to new friends and accomplish more than they ever thought possible, while teaching them more about each other—and themselves—than they ever imagined.</p><h2 id=who-is-making-39-migration-39>Who Is Making 'Migration'?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/migration-animated-movie-images-4-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Universal Studios and Illumination Entertainment are the production companies behind Migration with the movie being directed by Academy Award nominee Benjamin Renner who previously directed the critically acclaimed French animated features <strong>Ernest & Celestine</strong> and <strong>The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales</strong>. <strong>Guylo Homsy</strong>, who worked as the head of layout and cinematography of Illumination's <strong>Sing</strong> movies, co-directed the film. The movie's original screenplay was written by the renowned screenwriter<strong> Mike White</strong>, known for his work on hit films such as <strong>School of Rock </strong>and the Emmy-winning HBO series <strong>The White Lotus</strong>. <strong>Christian Gazal</strong> (Happy Feet) and <strong>Colin Stimpson</strong> (The Secret Life of Pets 2) served as the editor and production designer, respectively. Academy Award nominee <strong>John Powell </strong>(How to Train Your Dragon) composed the score for the film.</p><p>The film is produced by Illumination CEO <strong>Chris Meledandri</strong>, who is well-known for his creative vision and for producing some of the most beloved animated movies in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The film is very beautiful and has a painterly quality that is quite different from anything we’ve done at Illumination,”</p><p>Meledandri said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during an interview with Variety</a>.</p><p>"The story is told with humor and heart. It’s a remarkably human story with characters who are very relatable and end up wrestling with issues that we all understand, even though they are ducks. And their qualities as ducks are incredibly well executed, from the smallest detail on a feather to their movements and their flight. So it’s a movie that transports you into this world up in the sky, but at the same time it’s very true to who we are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kuqqz0ZqroqeeYratuNSmoKeZpJ68r3nRnqOemaOaeqWt055kqaSfqXq1vsCio56qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cyberpunk-2077-where-is-the-relic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cyberpunk 2077  Where is the Relic">&larr;
