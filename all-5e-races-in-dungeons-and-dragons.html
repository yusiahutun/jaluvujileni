The current edition of D&D, its fifth, has a good amount of systems and things to keep track of.</p><p data-injection=true>Take the races, for instance — there are a ton of different races for your characters and the ones that you encounter to belong to. If you want to know what each race is, along with their official description, then read on.</p><h2>Base races</h2><h3>Dragonborn</h3><ul><li>The Dragonborn are a proud race who stick to extremes. This means that they are rarely ever a “gray” character, either committing to full good or full evil.</li><li>They come with a +2 to your Strength score and a +1 to your Charisma score. They are taller than humans and have a base walking speed of 30 feet.</li><li>Each Dragonborn is descended from a specific type of dragon. When creating the character, you will choose which dragon you come from, and this will help determine the damage and area of your Breath Weapon, along with what type of resistance you’ll have.</li><li>You can also read, speak, and write both Common and Draconic.</li></ul><h3>Dwarf</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>Tending towards good, Dwarfs believe in the benefits of an organized society and possess a strong sense of fair play.</li><li>Playing a Dwarf will give your Constitution score a +2.</li><li>Dwarfs stand between four and five feet tall with a base walking speed of 25 feet. Your speed won’t be reduced by wearing heavy armor either.</li><li>Due to your background, Dwarfs have superior better vision in the dark, seeing things in Dim Light as if they were in Bright Light and things in Darkness as if they were in Dim Light. You can’t see color in Darkness, though — just shades of gray.<br>You are resistant to poison while having an advantage on saving throws against poison.</li><li>As a Dwarf, you are proficient in handaxe, battleaxe, light hammer, warhammer, smith’s tools, brewer supplies, and mason’s tools.</li><li>You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.</li></ul><h3>Elf</h3><ul><li>Creating an Elf character will grant you a +2 to your Dexterity score.</li><li>For the most part, Elves are peaceful creatures who prefer the good side of Alignment, with the exception being the Drow.</li><li>These Elves have spent a long time in the Underdark, in exile, and so they have become dangerous and bitter creatures.</li><li>Elves are of a Medium build and come with a base walking speed of 30 feet.</li><li>Just like a Dwarf, an Elf has Darkvision, which gives them better sight while in low-light conditions. And like the Dwarf, you cannot see colors in these conditions.</li><li>You have an advantage in saving throws against being Charmed and also cannot be put to sleep by magic. Instead of sleeping, an Elf will meditate for four hours a day, from which they will get the same benefits that a Human would get from sleeping for eight hours.</li><li>As an Elf, you can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.</li></ul><h3>Gnome</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>Creating a Gnome character will give you a +3 to your base Intelligence.</li></ul><p>-While tending to lean towards being Good, a Gnome can also lean towards the more Chaotic alignment. Even the most Chaotic of the Gnomes won’t be truly evil, though, due to the race’s light-hearted nature.</p><ul data-injection=true><li>You will come with a base walking speed of 25 feet.</li><li>You also possess Darkvision and won’t be able to make out colors while in low-light conditions.</li><li>Your cunning allows you to have an advantage in Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom against Mages.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common and Gnomish.</li></ul><h3>Half-Elf</h3><ul><li>The Half-Elf will give you a +2 boost to Charisma, as well as +1 to another two options of your choice.</li><li>A Half-Elf can be good or evil, as they resent any kind of authority over themselves, and even avoid authority over others.</li><li>They come with a base walking speed of 30 feet.</li><li>They come with Darkvision, which gives them an advantage in poorly-lit areas.</li><li>As a Half-Elf, you won’t be able to be put to sleep by magic and have an advantage on saving throws against Charmed.</li><li>You can choose one of a specific list of traits when creating your character.</li><li>You can speak, read, and write Common, Elven, and one language of your choice.</li></ul><h3>Halfling</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>Get an immediate +2 boost to your Dexterity stat.</li><li>Halflings are lawfully good, and hate to see others in pain. Though they are stuck in a traditional state of mind, they are still kind creatures.</li><li>They are a smaller race and come with a base walking speed of 25 feet.</li><li>When rolling for attack, ability check, or saving throw, a 1 will let you reroll the dice. You have to use the new result.</li><li>You have an advantage against frightened on saving throws and can move through the spaces of any creatures that are larger than you.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common and Halfling languages.</li></ul><h3>Half-Orc</h3><ul><li>As a Half-Orc, you will get a +2 boost to Strength and +1 to Constitution.</li><li>Due to their Orc ancestry, Half-Orcs tend to lean towards being Chaotic and rarely go for Good.</li><li>Their base walking speed is 30 feet and they come with Darkvision due to their Orc blood.</li><li>As an Orc, you are given a proficiency in the Intimidation skill which can be helpful in fending off attackers.</li><li>You also are able to reset to 1 hit point if you are reduced to zero without dying outright.</li><li>You are also a fierce combatant, being able to roll another dice to add damage when you land a critical hit with a melee weapon.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common and Orc.</li></ul><h3>Human</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>As a more balanced Race, Humans do not lean towards any specific alignment, nor do they come with an initial stat boost. While this may sound dull, it does present a much more open opportunity for character creation and development.</li><li>Humans have a base walking speed of 30 feet.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common, plus another language that you can choose.</li></ul><h3>Tiefling</h3><ul><li>A Tiefling will give you a +2 bump to your Charisma score.</li><li>The Tiefling are an independent Race, and as a result, easily end up being of the Chaotic alignment, though it is not a guarantee.</li><li>Your base walking speed is 30 feet and you come with Darkvision, thanks to your infernal ancestry.</li><li>You are resistant to fire.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common and Infernal.</li></ul><h2>Eberron Races</h2><h3>Changeling</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>As a Changeling, you will get a +2 boost to your Charisma score, while also being able to add +1 to any score of your choosing.</li><li>A very neutral race, a Changeling is ever rarely evil.<br>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li><li>You possess the Shapchanger ability, which allows you to alter your appearance and voice.

In this form, you get temporary Hit Points that are equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier.</li><li>You can choose a subrace that will determine different qualities of your character.</li></ul><h3>Warforged</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>As a Warforged, you are granted a +2 to your Constitution and +1 to an ability of your choice.</li><li>Warforged lean heavily towards law and neutrality, but some move against that and lean a little more chaotic.</li><li>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li><li>Warforged are incredibly resilient, being heavily resistant to poison, immune to disease, not needing to eat, drink or breathe, and not needing to sleep nor able to be put to sleep.</li><li>You are also full of natural defenses in your body that can be improved upon with armor.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</li></ul><h2>Elemental Evil’s Races</h2><h3>Aarakocra</h3><ul><li>These winged humanoids come with +2 Dexterity and +1 to Wisdom.</li><li>The Aarakocra are always good creatrues, though they can range between lawful and chaotic.</li><li>They come with a base walking speed of 25 feet, but can also fly at a speed of 50 feet, though you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.</li><li>You can deal excellent damage with unarmed attacks thanks to your sharp talons.</li><li>You can read, speak, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran languages.</li></ul><h4>Genasi</h4><ul data-injection=true><li>Genasi come with a +2 boost to Constitution</li><li>Being a very independent race, the Genasi tend to be neutral.</li><li>Their base walking speed is 30 feet.</li><li>Genasi come with distinct sub-races that are based on the different elements: fire, water, earth, and air.
