And now, the fan-favorite private eye makes his first television appearance in AMC’s <strong>Monsieur Spade</strong>. Set in 1963, the plot follows the famous private detective during his retirement days in the tranquil French community of Bozouls. But the return of an old adversary and the murders of six nuns in the town spoils his serene life. Monsieur Spade is created, written, and executive produced by Emmy-winning <strong>Scott Frank</strong> of <a href=#><strong>The Queen’s Gambit</strong></a> fame and <strong>Tom Fontana</strong> from <strong>City on a Hill</strong>. Fresh off his latest series, <a href=#><strong>A Murder at the End of the World</strong>,</a> Academy-nominated and BAFTA-winning <strong>Clive Owen</strong> stars as the titular protagonist. He also serves as one of the executive producers of the AMC original series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monsieur Spade is based on the popular fictional American detective created by Hammett and his novels focus on the character. Novelist, screenwriter, and political activist, Dashiell Hammett was best known for writing hard-boiled detective novels and short stories. Spade first appeared in the 1930 novel, The Maltese Falcon, and five other lesser-known short stories, including a serialized version of the novel. Sam Spade is characterized by his cold and aloof disposition, calculated moves, and lack of sentiment. At the same time, he is highly observant and always has a keen eye for detail, with an undaunted determination to achieve justice, albeit in his own ways, even if it’s defined as “ruthless”. Despite the character’s limited appearances in fiction, Sam Spade remains a widely popular figure and a major influence on the evolution of tough and hardened detectives in the generations following Hammett’s works. For instance, <strong>Raymond Chandler</strong>’s Philip Marlowe has some traces of Spade’s personality, especially his grittiness and his unflinching resolve to seek justice, whatever it takes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The character of Sam Spade has also found popularity in cinema, with several famous actors portraying the detective, namely, <strong>Ricardo Cortez</strong>, <strong>Humphrey Bogart</strong>, <strong>Edward G. Robinson</strong>, <strong>Howard Duff</strong>, <strong>Steve Dunne</strong>, <strong>Mike O'Malley</strong>, <strong>Tom Wilkinson</strong>, and <strong>Michael Madsen</strong>. Of all of them, Bogart’s portrayal of the famous fictional sleuth, in the 1941 film adaptation, remains iconic. <strong>The Maltese Falcon</strong>, <strong>Satan Met a Lady</strong>, <strong>The Black Bird</strong>, and <strong>The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It</strong>, are the only other films where the character of Spade has appeared, among several radio shows. AMC’s Monsieur Spade technically marks the first television series to feature Hammett’s popular detective. Set to arrive in early 2024, marking a thrilling start to the New Year, this period crime thriller is a much-awaited series for fans of Dashiell Hammett and/or detective fiction. So, while you wait for this all-new series to arrive, find out everything we know so far about Monsieur Spade, including plot, trailer, cast, and characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title>Monsieur Spade</h5>DramaThrillerCrime<p class=display-card-description><br>The famous detective Sam Spade is now 60 and living as an expat in the south of France in 1963.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>January 14, 2024</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Clive Owen</a> , Rebecca Root , Denis Menochet , Stanley Weber , Louise Bourgoin , Matthew Beard , Chiara Mastroianni , Clotilde Mollet</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Mystery</span> <strong>Writers</strong> <span>Scott Frank , Tom Fontana</span> <strong>Streaming Service(s)</strong> <span>AMC+</span> <strong>Directors</strong> <span>Scott Frank</span> Expand<h2 id=when-is-39-monsieur-spade-39-coming-out>When Is 'Monsieur Spade' Coming Out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mspade_photogramme_carolinesilhol_n4_rt-rt.jpg><p>Monsieur Spade is set to premiere on Sunday, January 14, 2024, on AMC, AMC+, and Acorn TV, at 9 pm ET/PT.
