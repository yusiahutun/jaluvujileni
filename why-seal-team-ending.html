However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>With the announcement that yet another primetime show has bit the dust, fans are left with endless questions as to <a href=# rel=noopener>why SEAL Team is ending</a> and how the final season could tie up the stories about America’s bravest men and women.</p><p>SEAL Team is a military drama series following the Bravo Team, a sub-unit of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group — the most elite unit of the Navy SEALs — as they undertake dangerous missions worldwide. The series premiered on CBS in 2017. It was moved to Paramount Plus in its fifth season in 2021.</p><p>SEAL Team is led by David Boreanaz, who plays Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Jason Hayes, also known as Bravo 1/1B, a leade of the Bravo Team. Boreanaz — who is best known for starring as Seeley Booth on Fox’s Bones from 2015 to 2017 — is also an executive producer on the series. SEAL Team <a href=# rel=noopener>also starred Max Thieriot</a>, who played Special Warfare Operator First Class Clay Spenser, also known as Bravo 6/6B, from Seasons 1 to 6. Thieriot exited the series to star as the lead in CBS’ Fire Country.</p><p>A year after Thieriot’s exit, CBS announced that SEAL Team was ending with its seventh and final season in 2024. So why was SEAL Team canceled? Read on for what we know about <a href=# rel=noopener>why SEAL Team is ending</a> and what the cast has said about the shocking decision.</p><h2>Why is SEAL Team ending?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Max-Thieriot-SEAL-Team.jpg alt="SEAL Team" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Why is SEAL Team ending? CBS announced on November 15, 2023, that SEAL Team was ending after its seventh and final season on Paramount Plus in 2024.&nbsp;“When we first heard the pitch for SEAL Team almost seven years ago, I was struck by the producers’ genuine passion to tell authentic stories that honored and celebrated the sacrifice of veterans and all those who serve our country,” CBS Studios president David Stapf said in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Since that first meeting, they have not wavered in that mission. The characters, storylines and cast performances have continued to be both nuanced and powerful. Thank you to David, Spencer, Chris, Mark and the entire cast and crew for their partnership, creative vision, and dedication. We are looking forward to an exciting and satisfying seventh and final season.”</p><p>Jeff Grossman, executive vp content and business operations at Paramount Streaming, added in his own statement: “SEAL Team has built an incredible legacy that celebrates and honors the brave men and women who serve in the armed forces. Our thanks to David Boreanaz and the entire cast and crew for bringing this phenomenal and thought-provoking series to life. We look forward to celebrating their work and giving Team Bravo fans a fantastic final season.”</p><p>Along with the announcement of SEAL Team’s final season, sources also told The Hollywood Reporter that a SEAL Team movie for Paramount Plus, which had been announced in February 2022, would also no longer move forward. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the SEAL Team movie had been on the backburner since it was announced in 2022 and was not in development when SEAL Team was renewed for a seventh season in January 2023.</p><p>So why is SEAL Team ending? The answer hasn’t been confirmed, however, fans suspect that it’s due to make room for newer shows on CBS and Paramount Plus based on the cancellations of other shows, such as Young Sheldon, which is set to end with its seventh season in 2024. Young Sheldon’s seventh and final season will premiere on February 15, 2024. The series will conclude with an hour-long finale on May 16, 2024.</p><p>In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, executive producers Spencer Hudnut and Christopher Chulack thanked Paramount Plus and CBS for allowing SEAL Team to run for so many years. “It has been a privilege to tell stories over seven seasons that honor the bravery and heroism of all who serve our country,” Hudnut and Chulack said in a statement.&nbsp;“We are deeply grateful to our amazing group of actors, writers, directors and talented crew, especially the hundreds of veterans who have worked on this show.&nbsp;We’d like to thank CBS Studios, Paramount+ and CBS for their partnership and support over the years, and we offer heartfelt gratitude to the fans who joined Bravo Team week after week and season after season.&nbsp;While we wish we could continue to shine a spotlight on areas where we can do better for our service members even after season seven comes to an end, it is our hope that the collective&nbsp;SEAL Team&nbsp;community will stay in the fight when it comes to protecting our protectors.”</p><p>Executive producer David Boreanaz — who plays Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Jason Hayes, also known as Bravo 1/1B — on SEAL Team — also issued his own emotional statement about SEAL Team’s cancellation.&nbsp;“For six seasons I have been fortunate and blessed to be a part of an outstanding cast and crew,” he said. “Every day spent was a note of thanks to our men and women in the military and Special Ops. I thank our fans, and I’m proud we were able to make this show to shine light in the darkness toward so many suffering today. I look forward to season seven and the opportunity to end this series with love and gratitude.”</p><p>SEAL Team‘s cancellation also comes after the series lost one of its lead stars, <a href=# rel=noopener>Max Thieriot</a>, who played Special Warfare Operator First class Clay Spenser, also known as Bravo 6/6B. Thiriot left the series after Season 6 to star as the <a href=# rel=noopener>lead of CBS’ Fire Country</a>, in which he plays Bode Donovan.</p><p>“At the time, I was fully involved with SEAL Team, so it was hard to imagine being able to go do something else, especially because this ramped up pretty quick,” Thieriot told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Collider</a>. “It became clear that it wasn’t like SEAL Team was gonna be over and done with, and here’s the next thing I could do, so I really wasn’t sure.”</p><p>SEAL Team is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Max Thieriot, check out his <a href=# rel=noopener>best TV shows and movies — from SEAL Team to Fire Country — in the gallery below.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuaW2Een%2BOsJ%2ByZaOarq15056YpmWVo7GqusZo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alexia-umansky-kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky-split.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexia Umansky Reveals How She Learned of Her Parents' Split">&larr;
