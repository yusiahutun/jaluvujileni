Watson’s height, weight and body, let’s learn more about the actress who has evolved before our eyes.</span></p><p><span>See also: Jennifer Lawrence Height, Weight, Bra Size, Net Worth</span></p><ul><li><span>She was born Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson on April 15, 1990 in Paris, France.</span></li><li><span>So basically she is of British and Turkish descent, she was born in France and raised in Britain.</span></li><li><span>This acting thing was no coincidence, Emma prepared for it.&nbsp;She attended Stagecoach Theater Arts School in Oxford, where she studied voice, acting and dance, and also took part in plays.</span></li><li><span>She was more than worthy of the role of Hermione Granger, as both she and the fictional character are geniuses.&nbsp;She graduated from school as an upright student.</span></li><li><span>Much like her to Hermione, she’s a geek, but not an all-out geek (remember her first flight lesson?).&nbsp;Her favorite school subjects are art, history and English, while her least favorites are math and geography.</span></li><li><span>She actually auditioned a total of eight times for the role of Hermione in Harry Potter.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Emma likes to cook, she relaxes and calms her nerves.</span></li><li><span>Emma has a spontaneous side, one of the craziest things she’s done was break into a hotel pool at 3am.</span></li><li><span>Emma loves fashion, mostly because she thinks it’s a great way to show off to the world.</span></li><li><span>She’s as plump as any woman can come, the star loves working out.&nbsp;She is particularly good at tennis, netball, rounds and field hockey.</span></li><li><span>One of her favorite actors is Johnny Depp and she is also a big fan of Julia Roberts.</span></li><li><span>She’s not just an on-screen performer, the star has expanded her horizons into voice acting territory.&nbsp;She voiced for the character of Princess Pea in 2008&nbsp;</span><i><strong><span>‘s The Tale of Desperaux</span></strong></i></li><li><span>Besides that, she is an activist.&nbsp;In 2014, Emma was named a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador.&nbsp;She went further and launched a campaign, HeForShe, which encourages men to pursue gender equality.</span></li></ul><p><span>Well, that’s as far as we can get today, let’s get back to the current topic starting with Emma Watson’s height.</span></p><p><span>See also: Katy Perry Height, Weight Net Worth</span></p><h2><span>Emma Watson Height</span></h2><p><span>Looking at her, you can tell she’s not on the big side, but you can also tell the star has reached a place where she’s comfortable with “all of her.”&nbsp;Emma is 5ft 5in tall and we can tell you for sure, if she is not happy with her height, there is someone out there who does and his name is Daniel Radcliffe.</span></p><p><span>Yes, he was initially worried that his “Harry Potter” co-stars would have major growth spurts and leave him behind, but his fears were allayed when they all stayed around the same height.&nbsp;All except Ron towards the end of the saga.&nbsp;Here’s what he told MTV News.</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t particularly worry because as long as Emma and Rupert weren’t shooting too fast either, I would look (very good).&nbsp;We would all look relatively (the same height).&nbsp;Everything was going to be fine.&nbsp;“Well, well, this just goes to prove what we said earlier, someone over there was very grateful Emma didn’t get too big.</span></p><p><span>Here is a list of other celebrities who share Emma Watson’s height.&nbsp;Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Demi Moore, Lindsey Lohan and Nicole Scherzinger are all as tall as the star.</span></p><p><span>See also: Brad Pitt’s children, wife, brother and daughter</span></p><h2><span>Emma Watson Weight</span></h2><p><span>For someone her size, she maintains a healthy weight of 50 kilograms and how she achieves this while looking as curvy as she is is still a mystery.&nbsp;Human nature is a strange thing though, people always seem to want what they don’t have.&nbsp;Although she has one of the most enviable bodies, it took her a while to come to terms with it.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what she had to say about it: “&nbsp;</span><span id=ext-gen78><span>I’ve come to terms with my body shape more as I got older.&nbsp;I went through a phase of wanting to have that straight and tall model look, but I have curves and hips, and in the end, you have to accept yourself for who you are.&nbsp;»</span></span></p><p><span>The star hopes her self-acceptance can inspire another young girl out there to embrace her body and not judge her whole self by what she looks like on the outside.</span></p><h2><span>Emma Watson body measurements</span></h2><p><span>Height: 5 feet 5 inches</span></p><p><span>Weight: 50 kilograms</span></p><p><span>Cup size: 32 B</span></p><p><span>Chest size: 32 inches</span></p><p><span>Waist size: 23 inches</span></p><p><span>Hip size: 34 inches</span></p><p><span>Feet/shoe size: US 7, EU 37-38, UK 5</span></p><p class=postsid
