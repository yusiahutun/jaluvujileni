It's a widely held belief that she has been - and remains - one of the great movie stars of all time, and watching her act shows that she does indeed live up to the hype. Though not every movie she's been in (and she has been in many) has been great, she herself has never turned in a disappointing or uncommitted performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The commitment to the craft of acting that Streep displays first got her recognized in the late 1970s, and she's worked steadily in the decades that have followed. While Oscars aren't always everything, it is also worth highlighting her immense success at the Academy Awards, as she's one of the few actors to have three Oscars for acting, with 21 nominations in total - she has the <a href=#>most acting nominations in Oscar history</a>. <strong>Some of her best roles and movies (Oscar-nominated or otherwise) are highlighted below</strong>, beginning with the very good and ending with her greatest.</p><h2 id=39-into-the-woods-39-2014><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>'Into the Woods' (2014)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-rob-marshall>Directed by Rob Marshall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meryl-streep-into-the-woods-vf02-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the notable movies Meryl Streep's been in, perhaps it's fair to call <a href=#><strong>Into the Woods</strong></a> one of the more divisive ones. It was a film adaptation of an acclaimed stage musical of the same name, which debuted in 1987 and stood out for being a creative (and dark) blend of numerous <strong>Brothers Grimm</strong><strong> </strong>fairy tales into one story.</p><p>The movie lightens things up a little, and perhaps for some, this leads to some of the magic getting taken away, with the movie version perhaps striving more for mass appeal.

Again, as can be said for many decent (if not quite great) movies featuring Meryl Streep,<strong> the movie might not be memorable if it had starred someone else</strong>, but Streep - and Nicholson here, too - both do a great deal of the heavy lifting and ultimately elevate Heartburn considerably.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><h2 id=39-don-39-t-look-up-39-2021><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>'Don't Look Up' (2021)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-adam-mckay>Directed by Adam McKay</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/don-t-look-up-2021-main-cast0.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The furor has died down as time has passed (as it so often does), but 2021's <a href=#><strong>Don't Look Up</strong></a> was very divisive when it first got released.
