He was born on November 17, 1995, in the United States of America. Jackson grew up with a regular childhood, unlike his father, who gained fame as a member of N.W.A. at a young age.</p><p>He was raised alongside his four siblings. His two older brothers, O’Shea Jr. and Darrell, and two sisters, <a href=# rel=noopener>Karima</a> and Deja, all have careers in the music industry, inspired by their father. O’Shea portrayed a character based on their father in Straight Outta Compton.</p><p>Ice Cube and Woodruff have tried to maintain a sense of normalcy for their children. Jackson appears to share this same wish, as he lives out of the spotlight.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span>Parents & Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=ql-align-justify>Kimberly Woodruff and Shareef Jackson’s father first crossed paths when she was a college student. While Ice Cube was immediately smitten, Woodruff was already taken and did not feel the same way.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>Six months later, they crossed paths again. By then, she was single and a romantic connection began to blossom between them. Their courtship officially began in 1988, and three years later, he asked for her hand in marriage. She said yes, and on April 26, 1992, they exchanged their marriage vows.</p><p class=ql-align-justify>On February 24, 1991, O’Shea Jackson Jr., the oldest brother of Shareef, was born to Kimberly Woodruff and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ice Cube</a>. Their second child, Darrell, was born on December 29, 1992. Both O’Shea and Darrell pursued careers as rappers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shareef-Jackson-Ice-Cube.webp alt="Shareef Jackson, Ice Cube" width=450 height=450 data-sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=ql-align-justify>O’Shea Jr. goes by the stage name OhMyGoodness (OMG), while Darell uses the name Doughboy as a nod to his father’s character in his first movie, Boyz n the Hood (1991).</p><p>O’Shea Jr. dropped a mixtape titled Jackin’ for Beats, which displayed his rapping abilities. He debuted as an actor in the film Straight Outta Compton, playing the role of his father. His exceptional performance led to a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><p>Darell is involved with Lench Mob Records, a record label that he helped create and currently oversees. The company was originally founded by his father.</p><p>Shareef Jackson’s two older sisters, <a href=# rel=noopener>Deja</a> and Karima Jackson, took different routes. Karima has excelled in academics, earning two MA degrees and working as a Research Assistant at Rutgers University Newark. Deja, on the other hand, is a skilled basketball player.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Despite having famous family members in the music industry, Shareef Jackson is determined to establish his own identity in the entertainment world. While his siblings have chosen to follow a similar path, Jackson has yet to express interest in pursuing a music career.</p><p>Shareef Jackson has inherited his father’s passion for basketball and frequently joins him at NBA games. He has been captured in numerous photographs sporting a basketball jersey. In addition to his love for basketball, Shareef also has a keen interest in American football and attends <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL</a> games with his family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ice-Cubes-son.webp alt="Ice Cube's son" width=519 height=591 data-sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Online sources state that Jackson’s net worth is estimated to be somewhere in the range of $1 million to $5 million.</p><p>His father, Ice Cube, a multi-talented American artist, is worth $160 million. He has evolved from being a pioneer of West Coast gangsta rap to becoming one of the most influential figures in Hollywood at present.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2iYZpyVmr1usMivnGahnqm8bsDHnmSloZaaerCyjKyfmqqVmrNutsCcoqynnmLAsLqMqJ1mnpGivLa%2FjKuYqaiVp3q0u82grquhpJq%2FbrXCnmScrZKafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./young-taylor-swift-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adorable Photos of Young Taylor Swift in the 2000s">&larr;
