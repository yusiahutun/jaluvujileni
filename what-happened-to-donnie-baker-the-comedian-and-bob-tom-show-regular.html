However, with Sexton’s unfortunate passing on July 21, 2023, we’ve sadly heard our last Donnie call.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=730 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Sexton’s sudden passing was a crushing blow to fans and the comedic community, but none were more affected than his close friends and family. Many wondered what could have caused the seemingly healthy 52-year-old to pass away so suddenly and unexpectedly. While an autopsy was ordered, it would take several months for the results to be returned, leaving friends and family in limbo. While there was much speculation around the circumstances of Sexton’s death, nothing would be confirmed until September of 2023. When the results of the autopsy were finally revealed, the news was difficult for many to hear. Here is everything that is known about what happened to Rox Sexton, the man behind the beloved Donnie Baker.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Donnie Baker?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donnie-.jpeg><p data-characters=843 data-current-count=1143 data-injectable=true>Rox Sexton is an American comedian best known for his role as the chaotic but loveable Donnie Baker on The Bob and Tom Show. Much of Sexton’s comedy success he attributes to being an only child, as Sexton spent plenty of time alone developing imaginary friends, a skill he used to full effect to create his iconic characters.&nbsp;A gifted impressionist, Sexton frequented the Bob & Tom Show with an ensemble of impressions like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Floyd the Trucker</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenny Tarmac</a>, but his most popular personality was that of Donnie Baker. A caricature of a Kentucky redneck, Baker always had a boat for sale, and developed several catchphrases like, “State Law!”, “I’ll say it right to his face,” and “I swear to God.” He was the perfect addition to The Bob and Tom Show and fans immediately took to the quirky character.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Sexton too grew attached to the character, and created a comedy band around Donnie, taking the persona to the stage in a musical comedy show, Donnie Baker and the Pork Pistols. The comedian regularly toured under his character, attributing his popularity to the idea that, “Everybody works with, everybody went to school with, or everybody is friends with somebody like Donnie.” Donnie was someone relatable, someone everyone could associate with.</p><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Sexton also released a series of videos on YouTube. His most popular video, “Missing Boat During Shark Week with Donnie Baker,” has more than 4 million views. The comedian also experienced a scare that made local headlines back in January. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He was nearly killed</a> during a drive-by shooting in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, when the husband of a woman Sexton was allegedly having an affair with was accused of firing shots at the well-known comedian. The charges were dismissed after Sexton’s death.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-donnie-baker-die data-injectable=false>How did Donnie Baker die?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Despite some upheaval in his personal life, Sexton appeared to be at the height of his career. He was touring regularly and making appearances across the country. Then on July 21st in Harrison, Ohio, Sexton’s body was found in a hotel room. His cause of death was initially unknown but was finally revealed in September 2023. The coroner’s report, as explored by the local station <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WLTW 5 </a>revealed fentanyl and ethanol (alcohol) poisoning to be the culprit.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>The comedian was just 52 years old, and on tour at the time of his death. He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to perform shows</a> throughout the summer. Tom, of The Bob & Tom Show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released a statement</a> on June 22, the morning following Sexton’s passing, confirming the comedian’s death and detailing the impact he had on the show. Sexton’s family also commented after his passing, saying, “It is with immense sadness that we let everyone know that&nbsp;Ron Sexton&nbsp;passed away yesterday. He was&nbsp;Donnie Baker&nbsp;to most of you, but Ron and Dad to us.”</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=false>Alcohol and drug use is not an uncommon occurrence in celebrity circles and unfortunately is the culprit for many<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> early deaths in Hollywood</a>. Rox Sexton will always be remembered for his comedic contributions and his personal relationships with those who knew him best. His comedic character of Donnie Baker will continue to live on through The Bob and Tom Show and in the memories of all of his fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZpyfo7uqsYybmKSdomLBqbGMnKamnZSerq95wKebZpqfl3q1u8xmqqGnp2K%2FprPUpZirZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-dwayne-the-rock-johnsons-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Dwayne The Rock Johnsons ethnicity?">&larr;
