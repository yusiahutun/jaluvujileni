Indeed, in 2012, the sportsman emerged as the first Vanderbilt player to rush for 1000 yards in back-to-back seasons and also secured his Special Education graduate degree, amongst everything else.</p><h2><strong>Delving Deeper Into The Profession</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59778 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-girlfriend.jpg.webp alt="zac stacy girlfriend" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-girlfriend.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59778 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Stacy kicked off his professional career to the maximum in 2013 when he was drafted in the NFL Draft with the St Louis Rams.</p><p>He stuck with the Rams for two years, building up his expertise on the field and testing his luck against other professional players before being traded to the New York Jets.</p><p>During his time with the Jets, Stacy suffered from several physical injuries, leading him to retire early from the NFL.</p><p>Despite this, Stacy couldn’t keep away from the pitch for long.</p><p>In 2018, he became an integral part of the Saskatchewan Roughriders and emerged as their leading rusher in their preseason games.</p><p>Regardless of his success, former teammate Tre Mason took Stacy’s spot, leading him to sign with the Memphis Express.</p><p>As one of the team’s dark horses, Stacy rushed a total of 12 times for 58 yards in the team’s week one loss to the Birmingham Iron.</p><p>In a total of 8 games played, Stacy managed to rush a grand total of 317 yards.</p><h2><strong>A Stand-Out Scandal</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59780 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-salary.jpg.webp alt="zac stacy salary" width=900 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-salary.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59780 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>However, this American football running back’s life wasn’t wholly golden with success.</p><p>In 2021, Stacy was submerged in a controversial scandal when he assaulted his ex-girlfriend whilst their 5-month-old son was in the same room.</p><p>The disturbing incident of Stacy pushing the child’s mother across the room was even caught on camera, depicting how she was forced against a TV, which then fell onto her.</p><p>Whilst this incident occurred in Florida in Stacy’s ex’s home, he was only actually arrested in Orlando.</p><p>He had already left Florida by the time the Orange County Sheriff’s Office had acted.</p><p>During the arrest, Stacy claimed that his ex-girlfriend had staged the attack out of bitterness.</p><p>Despite this, charges of aggravated battery soon caught up with him, and the football player’s reputation shattered in an instant.</p><p>In 2023, Stacy was sentenced to six months in jail and a year of probation.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Ricardo Pepi Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Zac Stacy – Net Worth</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59779 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-kristin-evans.jpg.webp alt="zac stacy kristin evans" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/zac-stacy-kristin-evans.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59779 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>So, how much is Zac Stacy worth?</p><p>Stacy accrued most of his wealth from playing in the NFL and CFL.</p><p>Zac made his National Football League debut for the St. Louis Rams in 2013 and was traded to the New York Jets in 2015.
