How old is he? Where is he from? What does he do for a living? Naturally, these are some of the questions that rose after watching the trailer for the show where Vinson appeared.</p><p>Well, you’ve come to the right place for the answers as we attempt to answer all of those in this short bio below. So, delve into this piece to find out more about Vinson Cornett.</p><h3><strong>Vinson Cornett On TLC’s Seeking Brother Husband</strong></h3><p>Following the huge success of Seeking Sister Wife, TLC is launching an exciting new spinoff. Interestingly, Seeking Brother Husband makes a subtle switch from polygamy to polyandry. Fans of TLC will get to see the exact opposite aspect of poly relationships from what they previously saw.</p><p>Four polyandrous couples and trios are introduced in Seeking Brother Husband as they experience the highs and lows of getting more husbands. Vinson Cornett is the prospective new “brother husband” joining the family of Kim Brewer Allen and Dustin Allen, and they all struggle with navigating boundaries and major life decisions.</p><p>Originally from Asheville, North Carolina, are Kim and Dustin. The pair have been together for twelve years and is very in love. Using the pen name “Soliloquy of the Soul,” Kim publishes blogs for readers in her hometown of Sullivan, Indiana. As a “truth seeker, soul speaker, and lightworker,” Kim characterizes herself.</p><p>The TLC actress writes about her experience with the goal of assisting others. Kim has always been a strong, involved, and outspoken Christian. Kim has always been a writer; at college, she switched from her old lock-key journal to a blog. She has been using blogs to chronicle her life ever since.</p><p>Kim has studied astrology, divination, and health and wellness in addition to religions and philosophies. Kim and Dustin have a cute young kid in common, but they seldom ever see her. Vinson, who is also their first brother’s husband, gets along well with both of them.</p><p>Vinson doesn’t have any updates on his social media since he likes to keep his private life hidden from the public.</p><p>Kim struggles as she navigates a new relationship with her two husbands, Dustin and Vinson. The “Seeking Brother Husband” actor made an effort to make Vinson and Dustin feel secure and accepted, but he’s not sure he’s ready to share Kim with anybody but the three of them. Kim breaks down in tears in the most recent trailer for TLC’s upcoming show as she attempts to care for both of her husbands. In the trailer, Dustin said that Vinson was the first guy he allowed Kim to date.</p><p>However, in the confession, Dustin said, “I was watching my partner fall for another man right before my eyes.” Meanwhile, when he was asked, “Are you OK with her sleeping with other men?” Dustin replied, “Most of the time.” Kim tried hard to work things out with her partner Vinson. At one moment, Kim breaks down into tears and told Vinson, “I wish I could be everything that you need. But I can’t.”</p><p>Talking about his prospective partners, Kim Brewer Allen is “a Truth Seeker, a Soul Speaker, and a Lightworker”. She runs a blog titled Soliloquy of the Soul which is a place “for people who are just trying to figure it all out – how to live, how to love, how to be happy. &nbsp;How to ferret out the deeper meanings of life and truly fulfill our purpose for existing.” Kim has always been a writer and helper. She traded the old lock-key journal for a blog back in college, and she has been documenting my life on the regular ever since.</p><p>She is 37 years of age.</p><p>Whereas, Dustin Allen is a massage therapist by trade. He received his training from The Center For Massage And Natural Health.</p><p>Dustin turned 42 in July 2022.</p><h3><strong>Vinson Cornett Job</strong></h3><p>Vinson Cornett is working as a sales specialist at AAG’s Prestige Subaru in Asheville, North Carolina.
