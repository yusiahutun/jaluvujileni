She will be the last one to know about Jason. She will probably be kissing Finn when someone walks in and tells her. Oy.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Technically, yes, but Heather was way before Liz was born. Heather is Steven Lars (Liz‚Äôs brother) mother.</p><p>On another note, has anyone informed Liz of Jason‚Äôs supposed death? If I was any of those women who have dealt with Jason, I would just take this news with a grain of salt. GH has been so wishy washy with this whole Jason storyline, any actor would probably stay away from that role because if the vaccine mandate is ever reversed (so to speak), SB will come backü§£</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I remember it was addressed briefly once in a scene, Heather was in an interrogation room of some sort if I remember correctly, and Elizabeth came in the room, and it was briefly mentioned in passing that while they have the same surname there was no blood relation connection.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>GH is filmed in CA and I don‚Äôt see the mandate being reversed here. NBC & CBS will probably have until Jan 4th to get all their employees vaxxed as well. CA is really strict with the vaccine and mask mandate. Even if government mandate isn‚Äôt enforced, most privately owned companies will enforce their own mandates.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Southern Cal may have mandates, but they have been wide open for months. I lived in Orange County for over 30 years, left before covid, but my friends who are there still say they haven‚Äôt had indoor mask mandates for months. No masks needed in grocery stores for months. All I can say is WTF.</p><p>Meanwhile, here in Oregon I have been forced to wear a mask at my grocery store for this entire time, except for a short few weeks before they announced the next panic, fearmongering report of more ‚Äúcases‚Äù.</p><p>Sorry to go OT.</p><p>Heather was married to Liz‚Äôs dad Jeff Weber before Liz was born. We don‚Äôt know who her mother is even to this date (and RH is in her 40‚Äôs) and we don‚Äôt know how old Liz is.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Elizabeth turned 18 in 1999 after Lucky ‚Äúdied‚Äù in th flire‚Ä¶Elizabeth was 15 when she first came to town and met Lucky‚Ä¶how old she is now no clue <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Sudser</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>December 7, 2021, 7:37pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>Although she was never shown Liz‚Äôs mother‚Äôs name is Carolyn. Jeff and Carolyn left Liz with friends, when they went to Africa with Doctors Without Borders. Liz ran away and showed up on Audrey‚Äôs doorstep in 1997 when she was 15, so she‚Äôs about 40.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>OC is totally different than LA. My entire family lives in OC and they tell me it‚Äôs like COVID doesn‚Äôt exist for most people. OC is a very conservative county in CA. My family members are all vaxxed and still wear masks when they go out. I was in OC a few weeks back and people were in fact wearing masks. I‚Äôm in LA and no one walks around without a mask in LA. No one. Our office has been closed for 2 years. I have been working remotely for 2 years. We have meetings via Zoom. No holiday parties and no gatherings since Covid hit. We just opened up again and everyone is required to wear a mask in the office. If you refuse to wear a mask, you are asked to leave the premises. GH is filmed in Hollywood and everyone in Hollywood CA wears a mask. You can‚Äôt enter a market, store, department store or restaurant without a mask. Employees of all these establishments are masked. So, yes the mandate is in full force in LA unlike OC.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>If you google GH Heather Webber, first link you can find a Wikipedia about her. Heather (Franco‚Äôs bio mom) maiden name is Grant. She married Jeff Webber and had Steven Lars who is Liz‚Äô older brother. Heather had Franco with Scott Baldwin, hence him taking the Baldwin name after. So there is not blood relation to Liz making no incest between her and Franco.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I can‚Äôt tell you how extremely happy I was to leave OC. It was great 35 years ago. Now? Omg, not so much.</p><p>It‚Äôs all ridiculous though. Over 20 million people just from LA to OC, and very low rates of virus it seems. Heard they got a rainstorm today too. Good for them.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I think OC is still a great place to live. Low virus rates? Maybe because 65% of the state is fully vaccinated and the number is growing. Also, the largest county in the state is following the mask mandate. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman_shrugging/2.png title=:woman_shrugging:t2: alt=:woman_shrugging:t2: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Heather was married to Jeff Webber, Liz‚Äôs father, back in the day. Franco and Liz shared Steven Lars as a brother cause of this, but aren‚Äôt directly related themselves. Same thing with Liz and Lucky.
