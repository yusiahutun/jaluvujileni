You can refund any <a href=#>game you purchase through Steam</a>, for any reason---whether it isn't working properly on your PC or you just don't find it fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This feature encourages you to try games you're not sure about. If you don't like a game, you can always refund it and get your money back. It's particularly useful now that so few games offer free demos.</p><h2 id=when-you-can-refund-a-game>When You Can Refund a Game</h2><p>There are two basic requirements for when you can get a refund: You must have purchased the game in the last 14 days, and you must have played the game for less than two hours.</p><p>If you meet these requirements, Valve promises it will refund you for any reason. You can ask for a refund on a game even if you don't meet these requirements---Valve will take a look at your request, but won't guarantee a refund.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can't refund games that you purchased outside of Steam and added to Steam with a product key (at least, not through Steam---you'd have to request a refund through the original retailer). While you can sometimes save money on Steam games by <a href=#>purchasing Steam keys from third-party game stores</a>, this feature encourages you to buy games through Steam if you think you might want to refund them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Get Free Steam Games</a></span></p><p>If you refund a lot of games, Valve may consider this "abuse" and stop offering refunds to you. "Refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam---not as a way to get free games," according to Valve's policy. Valve doesn't specify exactly what they consider "abuse", but you should probably be fine as long as you're not regularly buying a large number of games and refunding most of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valve notes that refunding a game purchased before a sale and buying it at the lower sale price isn't considered abuse. So, if you purchase a $60 game and it goes on sale for $30 a few days later, you can refund the game and purchase it at the lower price---as long as you've played it for less than two hours.</p><p>Your refund can be returned to the same payment method you purchased the game with, or to Steam Wallet credit you can spend on Steam. Read Valve's <a href=#>Steam refund policy</a> for more specific details about how the policy works.</p><h2 id=how-to-request-a-refund-for-a-steam-game>How to Request a Refund for a Steam Game</h2><p>If your game was purchased less than 14 days ago and you've played it for less than two hours, you're guaranteed a refund. Here's how to get one.</p><p>First, head to the Steam support site.
