Businesswoman</span></strong></h5><p><span>Yes.&nbsp;Although it’s not clear what it is, Kourtney Pogue runs her own business.&nbsp;Talk about a woman-preneur.&nbsp;She operates a website www.kourtneyereppert.com.&nbsp;There she posts photos of herself in a bikini shot and shares details about her modeling career with visitors.</span></p><h5><strong><span>2. Fortune</span></strong></h5><p><span>With a career in modeling, film, and others, it’s safe to call Kourtney Pogue a “money maker.”&nbsp;While we don’t know exactly what her net worth and salary is, we do know that her husband, Justin Turner, has earned $37 million as a baseball player so far.&nbsp;According to a 2018 estimate, his net worth is $18 million.&nbsp;Turner’s break came in 2014 when he had an offensive season and earned a whopping $2.5 million in arbitration.</span></p><h5><strong><span>3. Justin Turner’s wife</span></strong></h5><p><span>As far as we know, Kourtney and Turner started dating after five years together, Turner made a spectacular proposal when he took Kourtney to the Grand Canyon on March 13, 2017, got on one knee and popped the question.&nbsp;They married nine months later in December 2017. Their wedding was attended by close friends and relatives in Mexico;&nbsp;in a ceremony culminating in a breathtaking fireworks display.&nbsp;So far, there hasn’t been a post from either of them that included the words “expecting” and “child” or “baby.”&nbsp;When news like this pops up, we’re sure you’ll hear about it first.</span></p><h5><strong><span>4. Dog lover</span></strong></h5><p><span>In November 2018, Kourtney Pogue was deeply heartbroken and soon became vengeful when her beloved miniature pinscher, Dior, was violently murdered by a neighbor’s German shepherd.&nbsp;According to Kourtney, the dog’s owner knew it was violent with other dogs, and as far as Dior was concerned, the owner did nothing to stop it.&nbsp;In addition to suing the neighbor for vet bills and other expenses associated with Dior’s death, she also sought damages for pain and suffering because she could “rely on Dior’s emotional support for her well-being.”&nbsp;She now has a new dog, Moonlight.</span></p><h5><strong><span>5. Height and body measurements</span></strong></h5><p>Kourtney Pogue ist anmutig schlank gebaut. Sie ist 1,73 Meter groß, hat blaue Augen und blonde Haare. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt sind ihre Brust-, Taillen- und Hüftmaße groß. Außerdem haben wir noch keine genauen Angaben zu ihren BH-, Schuh- und Kleidergrößen.</p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Jynxzi’s age, height, real name, net worth, girlfriend, All to know about Junko">Jynxzi’s age, height, real name, net worth, girlfriend, All to know about Junko</a></h2><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Freddie Highmore’s wife?
