His mother Shirley Garnett and father O’Lewis McCullough were never married.&nbsp;In fact, the relationship between her parents reportedly ended after she was born.</span></p><p><span>Garnett grew up with his mother, two half-sisters and Ernest Irby, his stepfather, with whom he never gets along.&nbsp;Although he developed a love for basketball when he was in middle school, he only played organized basketball during his first three years of high school at Mauldin High School in Mauldin , South Carolina, where he demonstrated his love for football and presented extraordinary works.&nbsp;in-game skills by playing on the school basketball team.&nbsp;After high school, Kevin Garnett had to be transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago following a second-degree lynching charge against himself and other students after a neighborhood brawl between black and whites.</span></p><p><span>At Farragut Career Academy, he still didn’t let go of his love of football, he joined the school’s basketball team and was soon named player of the year by the high school national team.&nbsp;</span><i><span>USA Today</span></i><span>&nbsp;after leading the school team to a 28–2 record.&nbsp;In his four years at the top, he recorded an impressive record of 2,553 points, 1,809 rebounds and 737 blocked shots.&nbsp;In high school, Kevin Garnett played alongside another talented student, who later became professional basketball player Ronnie Fields.</span></p><p><span>After recording 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocked shots, Kevin was named the McDonald’s All-American Game’s Most Outstanding Player and subsequently became eligible for the 1995 NBA Draft. He was also honored as one of the top 35 McDonald’s All-Americans at the 35th Anniversary McDonald’s High School Basketball Game for All High School Students.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>He started playing professionally in 1995 after being selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1995 NBA draft, making him the first NBA player to be drafted straight from high school since 1975, as well as the youngest player of the NBA at that time.</span></p><p><span>After his first contract expired, Garnett agreed to a six-year contract extension with the Timberwolves worth $126 million.&nbsp;Many have condemned the deal, calling it a huge risk given the huge amount of money at stake. Popular analysts have actually speculated that the deal will prevent Wolves from signing new players.&nbsp;Wolves, however, had so much confidence in the abilities of the young and talented player, who quickly started delivering on his promise.</span></p><p><span>This season, Garnett has averaged 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks and 1.7 steals in each game.&nbsp;The Timberwolves finished the season with their first winning record in franchise history (45-37) and Kevin won his first All-Star.</span></p><p><span>Although Garnett was named to the second All-NBA team in the 2004-05 season, Timberwolves still failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in eight years, posting a record of 44–38 and the tension started to rise, not only for the team but also for the young player.&nbsp;The following season (2005-06) was no better, despite all of Garnett’s play the team still had the second worst record since Garnett joined the franchise and the following season the youngster was to be traded to the Boston Celtics in trade.&nbsp;for Sebastian Telfair, Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green and Ryan Gomes.</span></p><p><span>His Boston debut was in a game against the Washington Wizards and he recorded 22 points and 20 rebounds.&nbsp;In 2012, he agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Celtics worth $34 million.&nbsp;The following year, he recorded his 25,000th point in 116–95 wins over the Los Angeles Lakers.</span></p><p><span>When the 2013 NBA draft opened, the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets reached an agreement to trade Garnett along with Jason Terry and Paul Pierce for future first-round picks in 2014, 2016 and 2018 respectively.&nbsp;They did just that and that deal saw Garnett at the Brooklyn Nets until in 2015 he agreed to waive his no-trade clause so he could be traded to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young.</span></p><p><span>He played in 38 of the team’s first 45 games of the season, but missed the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury.&nbsp;Although Garnett wanted to play one more season with the Timberwolves, his knee injury didn’t heal as quickly as expected.&nbsp;He announced his retirement on September 26, 2016, after playing 21 seasons in the NBA.</span></p><h2><strong><span>after retirement</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kevin Garnett hasn’t been inactive since his retirement.&nbsp;The following month, after his retirement, he became a member of the TNT crew.&nbsp;</span><i><span>Inside the NBA,</span></i><span>&nbsp;and later the host of his own segment,&nbsp;</span><i><span>Area 21.</span></i><span>&nbsp;In 2017, he became a consultant to the Los Angeles Clippers and also consulted for the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2016-2017 season.</span></p><p><span>During his playing years, Garnett was also part of the United States national team that made it to the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he won a gold medal.</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Shaun Livingston Wife, Parents, Girlfriend, Salary, Height, Other Facts</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>At the end of his 21 career seasons with the NBA, Garnett had a net worth of $326 million, one of the highest in NBA history.&nbsp;This figure includes salaries, earnings, bonuses and endorsements.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Kevin Garnett’s (Brandi Padilla) wife?&nbsp;Kids</span></strong></h2><p><span>Garnett is married to Brandi Padilla.&nbsp;The couple tied the knot in a private ceremony held in California in 2004 after a long romance.&nbsp;The couple is blessed with two beautiful daughters.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and width</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kevin has such an intimidating height, which was probably one of the reasons he was so big.&nbsp;He is 6ft 1in i.e. 2.11in and weighs 109kg which totally balances things out.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGijlau2r3nGmqmnnaSperi1xZ5km6qRo7Gqec%2Bam6KknJZ6pLTIpZurnZ5itaa1xqGrZq%2BVnrSpwIyanp5lnprBbsPOq6uhZaeeuKp7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./starfield-all-books-you-can-sell-to-sinclairs-books-in-akila-city.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All Books You Can Sell to Sinclair's Books in Akila City">&larr;
