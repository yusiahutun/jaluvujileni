As per his approach, styling goes beyond putting fantastic outfits on his clients.</p><p>Law then explained,</p><h3>“I’m very cerebral about my craft. So, I actually create a blueprint for the girls that I’m working with. It’s what architects do, and instead of building houses, I’m building images.”</h3><p>Apart from styling the divas of Hollywood, Law also served as creative director for the latest Tommy x Zendaya collection. Moreover, he also served as a judge on America’s Next Top Model, a fashion-forward mentor.</p><h2>Age and Height: How Old Is Law Roach?</h2><p>It is no secret that Law Roach has helped many powerful women in the entertainment industry become a fashion icon.

Born on July 20, 1978, the celebrity stylist is 43 years as of now. Not to mention, Roach was born under the sun sign of Cancer, and people of this sign are known to be emotional, sensitive, and hard-working individuals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/law-002.jpg><p>Aside from the fact that his creativity in styling women has no limit, there is a limit to what we know about him. As of now, no details are there on Law’s height, weight, and other measurements.</p><p>However, we can see that the black-haired gentleman is relatively tall and has an attractive pair of dark brown eyes. Also, you will never see him slagging off with some pajamas or loose pants, no, no! Just like his clients, Law is styled to perfection.</p><h2>Early Life and Education: Where Is Law Roach From?</h2><p>Despite many claims and disbelief, Law Roach is, in fact, is his real name. Law was born to his parents in Chicago, Illinois, the United States of America.

So, we can bet that the celebrity stylist earns definitely more than we have heard.</p><h2>Personal Life: Is Law Roach Married? Is He Gay?</h2><p>Talking about his own life, Law Roach is single as of now. It seems the celebrity stylist has not found special someone, ‘him’ to be precise, to share his life with. Yes, if you guessed Law to be gay, then you are correct.</p><p>Surprisingly, Law never had to come out as gay to his high school peers and friends. Law stated that it was just natural with him, from his feminine mannerisms to his soft voice, it was apparent.</p><p>Furthermore, it was also the support of his friends that helped him get comfortable with his sexuality. He explained how he was bullied and termed ‘faggot’ once every while, but Law’s friends will step up and protect him.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Heist Professor Alvaro Morte Age, Career, Wife, Net Worth, >></a></h4><p>Now coming to the present state, Law is not a bit worried about the lack of action in his love life in any way.
