But this wasn’t the case for Blakely. Taking this job would make the beginning of the end of her life.</p><p>Exotic dancing was a financially cushiony job for her. She made enough money to move into her own apartment, completely out of her mom’s care.</p><h2><strong>Meeting Big Dino</strong></h2><p>While she was working as a dancer, she crossed paths with Michael Berry, referred to as “Big Dino.”</p><p>Dino was a repeat convicted felon and pimp.</p><p>He took young Blakely under his wing and began grooming her for a life of prostitution.</p><p>Big Dino took care of her, showed her love, and bought her anything she needed.</p><p>This was his way of reeling her in because those were all the things she was lacking in her life but desperately craved.</p><p>During this time, Falicia was also a single mom to a newborn, so any male support in her life brought her a significant sense of relief.</p><p>To Blakely, he represented everything she desired, and to that end, she worshiped him.</p><p>Her life quickly went from clocking in and out of her dancing job to giving in to the sexual demands of her clients, or shall we say Dino’s clients.</p><p>Blakely was only 15 when she met Dino and while things were going well, all things considered, her life would come to a halting stop just four years later.</p><h2><strong>The Downward Spiral</strong></h2><p>She had become close friends with Ameshia Ervin, a woman who shared the same profession as Blakely and frequented their social circle.</p><p>They did everything together, including committing three murders.</p><p>On August 15, Blakely was invited to her friend’s apartment, Ray Goodwin, to bring over some ecstasy.</p><p>Dino agreed to let her go over but told her to rob and murder Goodwin along with his friend Claudell Christmas who was at the apartment visiting.</p><p>He told her that it was her responsibility to murder both men, and if she didn’t comply, he would take her life.</p><p>Blakely had never committed crimes so egregious before, but she followed through to preserve her own life.</p><p>Ervin accompanied her to the apartment, but it was Blakely who pulled the trigger two separate times, killing both men.</p><p>As traumatizing as this scenario would be for the average person, it didn’t appear to phase either of the women.</p><p>In fact, they left the two men deceased in the apartment and made their way to a nightclub to enjoy the rest of the night.</p><p>While at the club, they ran into a young man, Lemetrice Twitty, who invited them both back to his apartment.</p><p>When they arrived, for a reason unknown, Blakely used the same gun from earlier and fatally shot the man.</p><p>The killer-duo fled the scene and called it a night.</p><h2><strong>The Arrest</strong></h2><p>It wasn’t until one week later when 19-year-old Blakely and her literal partner-in-crime would be arrested on unrelated charges.</p><p>The week following the murders, they decided to go on a string of robberies.</p><p>They robbed gas stations and small diners.</p><p>One fateful evening, they entered a diner, and fortunately for the owner, his intuition kicked and, and he called the police from a suspicion the girls who had just entered his establishment had ulterior motives than to order and pay for food.</p><p>The police showed up and had grounds to arrest the women because they were illegally driving the vehicle of one of the men they murdered one week earlier.</p><h2><strong>The Sentence</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55430 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Falicia-Blakely-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Falicia Blakely Net Worth" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Falicia-Blakely-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55430 class=wp-caption-text>@</p><p>The girls confessed to all three murders making it an open-close case.</p><p>Blakely was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the chance of parole, and Ervin took a plea deal confessing that it was Blakely who pulled the trigger all three times.</p><p>As such, she was given three life sentences as well, but with the chance of parole in 2024.</p><p>As for Big Dino, Blakely did everything she could to protect him, despite him coercing and threatening her to murder the two first men.</p><p>She was in love with him and thought he had her best interest at heart. After all, he was the only consistent male figure in her life.</p><p>At the time of writing, Blakely is battling HIV while serving her three life sentences at the Lee Arrendale State Prison.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>What is Jelly Roll’s weight</a>?</p><h2><strong>Falicia Blakely – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Falicia Blakely worth?
